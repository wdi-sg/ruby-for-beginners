        <h1>Modules</h1>

<p>It now makes sense to introduce another language feature in Ruby: modules.</p>

<p>In Ruby, modules are somewhat similar to classes: they are things that hold
methods, just like classes do. However, modules can not be instantiated. I.e.,
it is not possible to create objects from a module. And modules, unlike classes,
therefore do not have a method <code>new</code>.</p>

<p>So, what are modules useful for?</p>

<p>With modules you can share methods between classes: Modules can be included
into classes, and this makes their methods available on the class, just as if
we&#39;d copied and pasted these methods over to the class definition.</p>

<p>This is useful if we have methods that we want to reuse in certain classes, but
also want to keep them in a central place, so we do not have to repeat them
everywhere.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s have a look at this pretty contrived code:</p>

<p>```ruby
module Cream
  def cream?
    true
  end
end</p>

<p>class Cookie
  include Cream
end</p>

<p>cookie = Cookie.new
p cookie.cream?
```</p>

<p>We still haven&#39;t been able to come up with a better minimal example of a module
and class that makes more sense than this. And we fully admit that this code
is rather weird. However, it&#39;s good enough to quickly explain how modules work :)</p>

<p>If you run this code it will output <code>true</code>. Why is that?</p>

<p>The method <code>cream?</code> is defined on the module <code>Cream</code>, and all it does is always
return the value <code>true</code>. Now, this module is included into the class <code>Cookie</code>.
So, if we now instantiate a cookie, we can call the method <code>cream?</code> on it,
and it will return the value <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Cool. Let&#39;s move on and use this for our <code>Person</code> class, which will hopefully
then make more sense.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that our application has other classes that need to encrypt things.
And we want to keep the exact way of <em>how</em> we encrypt things, the <em>implementation</em>
in one single place.</p>

<p>Why would we want to do that?</p>

<ul>
<li>One reason could be that when we want to switch to a different way of
encrypting things (maybe use a stronger encryption algorithm), we would then
only need to change it in this one place, in our module, and be done with it.</li>
<li>Another reason could be that we want the encryption algorithm to be somehow
configurable, for example in a configuration file that our application reads.
This would then require additional logic that we would not want to duplicate
across all the places where we need to encrypt something: we&#39;d want all this
to be kept in a central place.</li>
<li>Another, much simpler, but sometimes also valid reason could be that we
simply want to move some clutter out of sight, and hide it away in another
file: so we can focus on what our <code>Person</code> class does, instead of having to
look at the nitty-gritty details of how exactly we encrypt things.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyhow. Here&#39;s how we can create a meaningful module for our application,
and then use it in the class <code>Person</code>:</p>

<p>```ruby
require &#39;digest&#39;</p>

<p>module Encryption
  def encrypt(string)
    Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(string)
  end
end</p>

<p>class Person
  include Encryption</p>

<p># ...</p>

<p>def encrypted_password
    encrypt(@password)
  end
end</p>

<p>person = Person.new(&quot;Ada&quot;)
person.password = &quot;super secret&quot;
puts person.encrypted_password
```</p>

<p>If you run this code, it will print out the same, encrypted version of the
password: cool, that&#39;s what we want.</p>

<p>We have moved the noisy details of the encryption algorithm to a module, and
then included the module to the class <code>Person</code>. This, at the very least, makes
the method <code>encrypted_password</code> much easier to read. Doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>We refer to the process of moving some logic (code) from one method to another
new method as &quot;extracting a method&quot;. In our case we have extracted the method
<code>encrypt</code> from the method <code>encrypt_password</code>. When we do this, methods usually become
shorter and more readable.</p>
