<p><em>Spheres of visibility, like rooms in a house</em></p>

<p>When we talked about variables we mentioned that the most common type of
variables is the &quot;local variable&quot;, without explaining any further why they are
local. Local to what? Where? We&#39;re finally ready to explain that more.</p>

<p>Since we have now talked about methods, we can also discuss another important
concept: scopes.</p>

<p>Wikipedia says: <em>&quot;In programming, the scope of a name is the part of a program
where the name is valid: where the name can be used to refer to something
else.&quot;</em> (slightly modified to match our own terminology)</p>

<p class="hint">
Names are known (or defined) in a certain scope, and unknown (or undefined)
outside of this scope.
</p>

<p>You can think about a scope as of a sphere, a bubble, or a room (with no
windows, and doors closed): Certain names, like variable names, are &quot;known&quot; and
&quot;visible&quot; inside of the room. Other names, known and visible in another room are
not known in this room, but only in the other room.</p>

<p>Every time there is a method call, and the flow of execution enters the
method&#39;s body, it enters a new scope, or &quot;room&quot;. Things that are &quot;local&quot; to
this method&#39;s scope (i.e. things that are &quot;inside&quot; of the room), are <em>only</em>
visible in this scope. Outside of it, they are unknown.</p>

<h2>Undefined local variable or method</h2>

<p>This is also a good opportunity to talk about an error message that you
might see most often. E.g. you&#39;ll see it every time when you made a typo
and misspelled a variable or method name.</p>

<p>Consider this code:</p>

<p>```ruby
def add_two(number)
  number + 2
end</p>

<p>puts add_two(3)
puts number
```</p>

<p>The line <code>puts add_two(2)</code> will output <code>5</code>, but the line <code>puts number</code> will
then raise an error.</p>

<p>This is because the variable <code>number</code> that is assigned the number <code>3</code> when we
call the method is a <em>local</em> variable. It is local to the method&#39;s scope. It
is created when the flow of execution enters the method.</p>

<p>Outside of this scope, when the flow of execution has returned from the method
the method&#39;s scope has been destroyed, and all local variables are gone. The
local variable <code>number</code> is therefore not known, and Ruby raises an error saying
<code>undefined local variable or method &#39;number&#39;</code>.</p>

<p>If you think about this error message for little bit, does it make sense to
you?</p>

<p>We have silently skipped over the fact that, in Ruby, both local variable
names and method names, are written the same way: they&#39;re just plain words.
For example, here:</p>

<p><code>ruby
number = 2
puts number
</code></p>

<p><code>number</code> is a local variable, and it is used in the line <code>puts number</code>.</p>

<p>However, here:</p>

<p><code>ruby
def number
  2
end
puts number
</code></p>

<p><code>number</code> is the name of a method. And it can be used (called) in the exact same
way: <code>puts number</code></p>

<p>This is because Ruby, when it executes a program, evaluates one statement after
another. And when it encounters a plain word like <code>number</code> then it will first
check if, within the current scope, it knows a local variable with the same
name. If so, it will use the value that is associated to this variable. If
there&#39;s no local variable with this name, then it will look for a method. If
there&#39;s also no method with this name it will then raise the error message
<code>undefined local variable or method &#39;number&#39;</code>.</p>

<p>So the error message is pretty precise, but also sounds kind of convoluted. What
it basically tries to say is:</p>

<p><em>You&#39;ve used the word &quot;number&quot; here, and i don&#39;t know it (in this scope). Did
you mean to use a local variable? Or a method?</em></p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Back to the topic of local scopes. Let&#39;s look at another example:</p>

<p>```ruby
number = 1</p>

<p>def add_to(number)
  number + 2
end</p>

<p>puts add_to(3)
```</p>

<p>What do you think the output will be? Will it be <code>3</code>, or <code>5</code>? Something else?</p>

<p>If you run the code you will see that it&#39;s <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>The reason for that is that we do assign the number <code>1</code> in the outer scope to a
variable <code>number</code>, but this variable is then never used: the only other line in
the outer scope is the last line <code>puts add_to(3)</code>, and this line does not use
the variable <code>number</code>.</p>

<p>Instead, when the control flow enters the method <code>add_to</code> Ruby will create a
new local scope, and it will define a new local variable <code>number</code> which is
assigned the number <code>3</code> that was passed to the method. This new variable
<code>number</code> is <em>local</em> to the method&#39;s scope, and therefore this is a <em>different</em>
variable than the one on the very first line, in the outer scope.</p>

<p>We found the following a good metaphor for scopes:</p>

<p>When Ruby enters a method, it&#39;s like she enters a shiny new room in a
house. With her, she brings the objects that are passed as arguments to the
method call. In the example above she brings an object that is the number <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as Ruby enters the method, she sticks post-it notes on the
objects, according to the argument list from the method definition. In our
example that is the name <code>number</code>. So from now on, in this room, there&#39;s a
known local variable that has a value assigned: The object (number) <code>3</code> with
the post-it note <code>number</code> on it.</p>

<p>In our example, the outer scope and the scope of the method <code>add_two</code>, are
two different rooms, and there are two different post-it notes stuck on
two different numbers, which just happen to have the same name on them.</p>
