# Ruby For Beginners

*Ruby Monday Study Group curriculum for beginners*

You can [read it online here](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org).

This book is built using [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com).

The source code is kept on the main branch. The `build` directory is
`.gitignore`d and should be initialized with another git repository so it can
be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch in order to deploy changes to the site.

After making changes, once you've committed them, you can publish your
changes to the website using:

```
./bin/publish
```
