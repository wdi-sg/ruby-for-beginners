          <h1>Ruby For Beginners</h1>

<p><em><a href="http://rubymonstas.org">Ruby Monday Study Group</a> curriculum for beginners</em></p>

<p>This book has been written after we have run 4 beginners groups at our <a href="http://rubymonstas.org">Ruby
Monstas</a> groups in Berlin, and it outlines the current
state of our beginner groups curriculum.</p>

<p>After completing this curriculum you&rsquo;ll be able to read, understand, and write
basic Ruby code yourself:</p>

<p>You can use this knowledge to create small tools that might help you in your
day-to-day work (such as converting numbers, or extracting data from files)
that normally would cost a lot of manual work. You&rsquo;ll be able to jump into
other tutorials, and have a much easier time understanding what they&rsquo;re
talking about. And you can start working on our next curriculum which will
walk you through the basics of building an actual
<a href="http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org">web application</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to print this book, or export it as a PDF try using <a href="print.html">this page</a>,
which is a single-page version of the entire book.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/rubymonsters/ruby-for-beginners">source code of this book here</a>.</p>

  <h1>Preface</h1>

<p>Read this book at your own pace, and do exercises at your own pace.</p>

<p>We recommend reading at least a page a day (ideally more), and taking some more
time, at least once a week, in addition to the weekly meeting on Mondays. It often
helps to meet with others, have some coffee and cake, and hang out while reading some
more of this book, or doing a few exercises together.</p>

<p>We suggest that you read the book from beginning to end, and do exercises as you go.
If you come across chapters that you feel are too theoretical you can skip them for
the time being and come back to them later, if needed.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d prefer to jump right in, you can also skip over the introductory
chapters. Jump to the chapter &ldquo;Your tools&rdquo;, and read the introductory
chapters later. If you already feel familiar with your editor and terminal, and
know how to use <code>ruby</code> to execute a Ruby file, then you can skip over the
chapter &ldquo;Your tools&rdquo;, too.</p>

<p>Take notes about whatever questions come up during the week, things that you
don&rsquo;t understand, and everything else worth mentioning (for example, epiphanies
you have, or things you found interesting). Bring your notes to the study
group so we can talk about them in the group.</p>

<p>Please help us improve this book for others: Whenever you find something unclear

<p>We also recommend looking at, reading, and working through other resources,
as much as you can. Every beginners book expresses things a little bit differently, in a
different order, and from a different angle.</p>

  <h1>Programming is creation</h1>

<p><em>Things coming to life</em></p>

<p>Programming is creation. Whenever you run a program a little universe is
created. Things come to life and interact with each other, according to the
rules that you, as their creator, define.</p>

<p>Imagine you build an application like Twitter. Then, as a developer, in the
programming language of your choice, you would say things like &ldquo;Let there be
users! And let there be tweets!&rdquo;, and once your application starts these things
will come into existence. Next you would go ahead and define &ldquo;Users can create
tweets, and they can follow each other&rdquo;. And from now on, every time new users
are created in the little universe that is your application, these users will
have the ability to tweet and follow each other.</p>

  <h1>Learning to program</h1>

<p><em>Brainwashing yourself</em></p>

<p>Learning to program means, fundamentally, two things: Learning a new language,
and learning to solve problems by way of using this language. This means writing
code and describing your solution to the problem.</p>

<p>When this text, the one that you are reading right now, was written, the author
used the language English trying to come up with an adequate solution to the
problem &ldquo;How can someone best start learning to program?&rdquo; Reading this text you also
use the language English. If you think about what you are doing right now, you
will notice that you do not <em>think</em> about English as a language at all. Right?
Instead you <em>use</em> the language in order to figure out what this author might be
talking about, and what that might mean to you.</p>

<p>Try to remember when you last walked up the stairs. Walking up the stairs is a
pretty complex series of movements, and it took you quite a while to properly
learn it as a child. The exact order and coordination of movements, bending
your knees, ankles, while keeping your overall balance, is so complex that we
probably wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to describe it properly. However, we have somehow
managed to learn this ability and we can now use it.</p>

<p>The point I am trying to make here is: When you last walked up the stairs
you were thinking about all sorts of things. Maybe you were on the phone
with someone, searching for your keys in your pockets, and thinking about looking for
a nice introduction to programming online &hellip; maybe you did all of this at the
same time. Whatever it was, you did not think about how exactly to bend your
knees and ankles while trying to maintain your balance and get up to the next
step.</p>

<p>Programming is very much the same. As programmers, while we program, we do
not <em>think</em> about the programming language, and how to use it. Instead we
simply <em>use</em> it, and meanwhile think about very different things, such as the
problem we are trying to solve, how we can make things easier for fellow
programmers, how to best suit the needs of our users, or customers, and so on.</p>

<p>When you start learning to program you will first learn about the basic
concepts of the programming language. And you sometimes may feel slightly
overwhelmed, and wonder how programmers might be able to remember all this
stuff. The trick is: they don&rsquo;t, consciously. Instead they have assimilated
these concepts so much that they are able to simply use them, without
consciously remembering or thinking about them. Just like you use English,
or your ability to walk up the stairs.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why learning a programming language, just like learning any other
language, or skill, is a lot about repetition: You basically brainwash yourself
into being able to form meaningful &ldquo;sentences&rdquo; (code) without having to think
about the concepts that you are using.</p>

<p>Over time, while you repeat basic concepts of Ruby over and over again (by
way of doing exercises and writing code) you will notice that things become
very natural, and this probably will happen much quicker than you think.</p>

<p><em>At first, you will not understand anything. It&rsquo;ll be weird, just like with
learning any human language. You will struggle with words, and not know what
symbols are what, and it&rsquo;ll all be very confusing. Then one day BANG your brain
will snap and you will suddenly &ldquo;get it.&rdquo; If you keep doing the exercises and
keep trying to understand them, you will get it.</em> from the great book <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/intro.html">Learn
Ruby The Hard Way</a> by Zed Shaw.</p>

  <h1>Learning modes</h1>

<p><em>People are different</em></p>

<p>Different people learn things in different ways.</p>

<p>Some like to listen to lectures, or read books that thoroughly explain concepts
before they then start exercising, and experiment with what they just learned.
Others like to get their hands dirty, and play with code until it does what
they want.</p>

<p>Some want to fully understand what a certain line of code does, and why.
Others don&rsquo;t care that much about the details, and want their code to produce
the right things instead. They might memorize what worked, and understand things
more fully later.</p>

<p>Some understand concepts in logical ways, and go precisely by their definitions.
Others understand things better by coming up with good analogies and metaphors.
And yet others tend to simply memorize things and how they get used.</p>

<p>Therefore there is no one true path or one-size-fits-all approach to learning
programming. Try different things, and pay attention to what works well for you,
what is the most fun to you, and keeps you motivated.</p>

<p>If you find it hard to keep motivated working through a certain online tutorial,
or if you have a hard time fully understanding what an exercise is about, then
try to pick a different approach, or talk to your study group.</p>

<p>Consider meeting with others during the week, have some coffee and cake and
hang out, read some more of this book, or do a few exercises together.</p>

<p>Also, consider joining local programming events, like meetups, hackdays, or a
conference once in a while. That gives you a broader perspective, even if you
might not be able to fully understand everything all the time. Meeting with
others and hearing about their experiences can also be a good source for
inspiration and motivation.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t put a lot of time into learning programming, then consider
spending at least a few minutes on it every day. For example, every morning,
before you leave the house, take 10 minutes to read a page in a programming
book, review an exercise, or read some code. Or spend some time with it
on the train on your way home from work later. This will keep your subconscious
mind busy with programming concepts, and help you pick things up more easily 
later.</p>

  <h1>Don&rsquo;t believe everything we say</h1>

<p>While you are learning to program you&rsquo;ll talk to seasoned developers, ask
questions, and listen to their advice, tips, and experiences.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great! We recommend you listen closely, try to understand, and ask more
questions.</p>

<p>However&hellip;</p>

<p>Always try to put things into perspective. Whatever you hear, try to
understand, compare with other opinions, and judge for yourself.</p>

<p>As in any other field, developers, as much as any other person, will always
give answers based on <em>their</em> own perspective, based on <em>their</em> own experience,
and based on what <em>they</em> think is a helpful answer to you. Now, being a great
Ruby developer (&ldquo;knowing your stuff&rdquo;) and being a great Ruby coach (&ldquo;giving the
right advice&rdquo;) are not the same thing.</p>

<p>Developers who have never coached, or are new at coaching, tend to, for
example, overload you with information. They know all this stuff, and, as said
before, they aren&rsquo;t even fully aware of it. They just <em>use</em> the language, and
all these features.</p>

<p>Now, when asked to explain things, and may suddenly remember: &ldquo;Oh, right, and
then there&rsquo;s also this other language feature, and that one, and another one,
and &hellip;!&rdquo; They may be excited to explain all the things at once, without
realizing that, at this particular point, you actually don&rsquo;t need to know
them all at once.</p>

<p>Also, they might present a conclusion, and omit the learning process. In
programming, as much as in any other field, there&rsquo;s rarely any silver bullet.
There are always alternative solutions, with different advantages and
downsides. Often it&rsquo;s hard to fully understand them unless one tries a
particular solution and sticks with it for a while.</p>

<p>On top of this, whatever is considered a &ldquo;good&rdquo; solution by the community at
any point of time, is always the conclusion of a decades-long evolutionary learning
process. Often it makes sense to start practicing with an older and
simpler solution that worked well enough a couple of years ago, and experience some of
the problems it caused, and only then try using the latest, more modern
solution.</p>

<p>Developers often tend to be excited about their current preferences, and 
things they&rsquo;ve learned just recently, and will happily explain at length why
one solution works better for them than another. Often you can learn a
lot from listening to these explanations. However, keep in mind that this
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean a tool that&rsquo;s great for an experienced programmer 
is also a tool that&rsquo;s great for learning to program.</p>

<p>On top of all this, there&rsquo;s also the problem that the tools we use, over
time, become more and more optimized for advanced users. New features are being
added that make our day-to-day work easier, and over the years, up-to-date
documentation and tutorials will focus on these features.</p>

<p>While that&rsquo;s great for advanced users, it&rsquo;s sometimes bad for beginners, as you
now not only need to understand the basic concept, you also need to understand
this additional, more abstract feature that sits on top of it.</p>

<p>A good coach will try and adjust to these things, but doing so also is a skill
that needs to be learned. Try to give feedback, and help your coaches improve.</p>

<p>Of course, everything said above also applies to ourselves :)</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of decisions we made for our study groups. Don&rsquo;t worry
if you don&rsquo;t understand what we&rsquo;re talking about at this point. You&rsquo;ll fully
understand them once we get there during study group.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We use the old syntax for hashes in beginners groups: When you first learn
what a hash is, and how it is used, this is quite a bit of information to
process. The new hash syntax puts an extra burden on you, and raises extra
questions that just aren&rsquo;t required to be answered in order to understand
what a hash is, how it can be used, and why it is useful. We do mention the
new syntax, and explain why we do not use it.</p></li>
<li><p>We purposefully ignore tons of language features, such as for and while
loops, lambdas, splats, class level methods, class variables, and so on. Our
goal is to get to the point where you can write a simple Sinatra application
while fully understanding everything you use in terms of Ruby language
features. We found this is the point where it starts getting more and more
exciting for most students: You can now build your own web applications, and
understand what you&rsquo;re doing. For this, many language features simply aren&rsquo;t
required.</p></li>
<li><p>We use the test framework that is integrated into Ruby on Rails, rather than 
RSpec, another, more modern framework that is preferred by many (but not all)
Ruby programmers. Why? It is easier to understand: methods are just methods,
not method calls that generate other methods that magically do things. You
don&rsquo;t need to learn a lot in order to start writing your first test, and
there is no additional setup required. Later on, once you&rsquo;ve written a good
bunch of tests, it is a great idea to then learn RSpec, and try that one
for a while.</p></li>
<li><p>One example of technology improving, adding features optimized for more
advanced users, and thus making it harder to understand for newcomers, is the
aforementioned new hash syntax. Other examples are:
Rails&rsquo; <code>resources</code> macro in routes (it is much easier to understand the whole
concept if you type out these 7 routes yourself), and Rails&rsquo; migrations
(they&rsquo;ve gone, for good reasons, from being numbered to being timestamped,
making the naming choice <code>migrate:up</code> and <code>migrate:down</code> harder to
understand; and they&rsquo;ve introduced the method <code>change</code>, replacing the methods
<code>up</code> and <code>down</code>).</p></li>
</ul>

  <h1>Formatting your code</h1>

<p><em>Keeping things pretty</em></p>

<p>By &ldquo;formatting code&rdquo; we refer to the way code is indented, or not, where and
how whitespace is being used in order to separate things visually, or not, etc.</p>

<p>For example, even though this code won&rsquo;t mean a lot to you at this point (it
will, in a few chapters), it is formatted well:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">widths</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">row</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">cell</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">cell</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">width</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Even without understanding what these few lines of code do at all, from just
looking at it one can recognize a certain structure: things are somehow
nested, and stuff that sits on the same horizontal indentation relates to
each other visually.</p>

<p>On the other hand the following code also is perfectly valid Ruby code, in the
sense that Ruby will happily run it, and it does exactly the same. However,
it is not formatted very well at all (in fact it&rsquo;s quite a mess, isn&rsquo;t it?):</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">widths</span> <span class="p">(</span>     <span class="n">row</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
 <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">cell</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">cell</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">width</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
     <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This <em>does</em> the same, technically: Ruby will run it. But it does not <em>look</em> and
<em>read</em> the same, simply because of the way it is formatted.</p>

<h2>Pattern recognition</h2>

<p>When you talk to developers about your code you will probably notice very
quickly that we are all obsessed about how exactly we&rsquo;d like code to be
formatted.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a good reason for that, and you should try hard to learn how to use
your editor in order to format your code properly, so over time, you can become
obsessed, too :)</p>

<p>The reason for this obsession is pattern recognition: The ability of our brain
to help us recognize things subconsciously, from just glancing over them.</p>

<p>Imagine you are driving a car, and there&rsquo;s a kid playing with a ball on the
sidewalk. Even if you only see the kid from the corner of your eye your brain
will immediately process this information and even assign a meaning to it.
You&rsquo;ll start paying attention, and maybe lower your speed immediately.</p>

<p>Often when you search for something online, and look at a couple of
websites, your brain will help you recognize things that you are looking
for without consciously thinking about the structure of the site.</p>

<p>In the same way, as a programmer, when you look at code, you will immediately
recognize some of its structure, and thereby understand it, without reading it
thoroughly. This allows you to to grasp the overall picture of what you&rsquo;re
looking at, and quickly find something that you&rsquo;re looking for, in order to
then read this particular part of the code more carefully.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, in order for this kind of pattern recognition to kick in,
code needs to be formatted consistently and carefully.</p>

<p>Another aspect of this is that looking at &ldquo;badly&rdquo; formatted code causes
discomfort to an extent that it is described as causing physical pain. While
this might seem like an exaggeration, there&rsquo;s something important to it.</p>

<p>Because of how pattern recognition works, as a programmer, whenever there&rsquo;s
a small issue with the formatting of some code, you will immediately notice
it, and distract yourself from other thoughts. You&rsquo;ll need to re-focus on what
you were trying to accomplish, and whenever you come back to the code it will
distract you again.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why developers often feel the urge to fix even small formatting
mistakes immediately. People might outright refuse to talk about your actual
code, and any questions that you have, before you&rsquo;ve added this one extra space
here, and indented that other single line there.</p>

<p>(One certain aspect of this has been even baked right into the language Ruby.
For example, by definition, class names must start with an uppercase letter.
On top of this, the Ruby community has agreed on conventions for how to
write other names. We&rsquo;ll get to this once we talk about variables and
classes more.)</p>

  <h1>Reading error messages</h1>

<p><em>Your new best friends</em></p>

<p>As programmers we want to build things that work. When we do exercises we want
to figure out the solution to the given problem. Seeing error messages therefore
has a negative connotation to it: we haven&rsquo;t managed to get it right! Right?</p>

<p>Well, yes. But also, no. Errors can also indicate progress. Often error
messages indicate that we&rsquo;ve done the right first step, and now have to figure
out the right next step.</p>

<p>Whenever you find an error message printed on your terminal, don&rsquo;t fret.
Instead, appreciate it. Read it carefully. Ruby is trying to give you a hand
and help. Normally an error message tells you exactly what went wrong in your
code, and where. Once you&rsquo;ve understood what has happened look at your code and
try to understand why it happened, and how you might fix it.</p>

<p>Often, when you fix one thing, you&rsquo;ll get a different error message.
That&rsquo;s progress. Rinse and repeat until your code does what you want.</p>

<p>For a beginner, Ruby error messages can sometimes be hard to read. There are
certain conventions used, e.g. for indicating there&rsquo;s an instance of
a certain class involved. Backtraces might be hard to read and might look
frightening. But all they do is tell you the exact path of execution Ruby
took until it ended up raising an error.</p>

<p>If you do not understand an error message and you have the opportunity to
ask someone else, then do so. You&rsquo;ll get better and better at reading
error messages over time. And you&rsquo;ll become friends with them.</p>

  <h1>Using Google</h1>

<p><em>Someone else has already had that question</em></p>

<p>Whenever you have a question, and you&rsquo;re not sure where to start looking for an
answer, simply go ahead and ask Google. Some other person most probably has had
the same question before, and often times you will find a helpful blog post,
tutorial, documentation, or answer on community sites like Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>Finding the right terms to type into Google might take some time. Experiment
with this. If one question does not yield a helpful result on the first page,
try to rephrase your question. You&rsquo;ll get better and better at this over time.</p>

<p>Always include the keyword &ldquo;ruby&rdquo; though, so you don&rsquo;t get answers for other
programming languages.</p>

<p>E.g. if you are wondering if there is a method that gets you all the keys from
a hash, then google for &ldquo;ruby hash get keys&rdquo;. If you are wondering if there&rsquo;s
a method to align strings so they all have a certain length, then google for
&ldquo;ruby string align&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Google results that link to the Ruby documentation on ruby-doc.org are often 
good ones to look at, but these pages also often are very long. Look at the
summary of the page on Google, and the highlighted terms, then go to the
page and use your browser&rsquo;s search feature to find them on the page.</p>

<p>Also, results on Stack Overflow are often very worthwhile to read. This is a
programming community site where people with all kinds of experience levels
post questions, which then will be answered by others. People can rank answers,
and the best ranked answer appears at the top. Often it is worth skimming
through most of the answers, as sometimes the question asked is just slightly
different from yours, but someone might still suggest a solution that might be 
similar to the one you are looking for.</p>

  <h1>Your tools</h1>

<p>When you start learning programming in Ruby you&rsquo;ll need three tools: A text
editor, a terminal, and a Ruby runtime.</p>

<p>As a programmer you&rsquo;ll spend tons of time working with your text editor and
terminal (or &ldquo;in&rdquo; them, as we say). It makes sense for you to learn how to use
these tools, and how to customize them so they fit your taste.</p>

<p>There are also text editors that can be integrated into a terminal window. This
means you don&rsquo;t have to switch between applications. There are also online
services that integrate all of this as a web application, with a nice interface
in your browser.</p>

<p>Feel free to try all these things out, and play with them as much as you like.
However, for our study groups, we have found that using the simplest tools
possible, at least for a while, works best: It reduces the amount of things
people need to learn in the beginning, and everyone learns the same few basic
things that are required to run a Ruby program in this environment.</p>

  <h1>Text Editor</h1>

<p>For our study groups we recommend using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>
as a text editor, which you can download and run on Mac OSX, Ubuntu, or
Windows. This is an editor that has been specifically designed for writing
code, comes with a lot of great tools, and can be easily customized.</p>

<p>Other text editors that might be worth looking at are Atom, Textmate 2, and, if
you like to use some of the powerful oldschool tools from the early times of
Unix, VIM and Emacs. These are all great editors to use.</p>

<p>Whatever editor you use, you want it to insert 2 spaces when you hit the &ldquo;tab&rdquo;
key, i.e. when you want to indent your code. Make sure your editor is
configured to do this.</p>

<p>For Sublime Text you can do the following: In the menu item &ldquo;Sublime Text&rdquo; go
to &ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Settings - User&rdquo;. This opens up a configuration
file that you can edit just like any other file. Make sure it looks like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"tab_size"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"translate_tabs_to_spaces"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

<p>Also, we recommend enabling auto-saving your files. This will automatically
save your changes when you switch to another application (like your terminal),
and protect you from the mistake of forgetting to save:</p>
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"tab_size"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"translate_tabs_to_spaces"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"save_on_focus_lost"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

<p>Whenever you open a new file, make sure to save it with a filename that ends
with <code>.rb</code> first. This will tell the editor that you want this to be a Ruby
file. Your editor will start highlighting your code as Ruby code, and enable other
Ruby specific editor features. Alternatively, select &ldquo;Ruby&rdquo; in the extensions
menu at the bottom right.</p>

<p>Some keyboard shortcuts that are extremely useful to know are:</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to indent or unindent a single, or multiple lines of code, select
them and hit <code>tab</code> or <code>shift-tab</code> respectively.</li>
<li>In order to comment single, or multiple lines of code, select them, and
hit <code>cmd-/</code> on Mac OSX, or <code>ctrl-/</code> on Linux/Windows.</li>
<li>Cut out code with <code>cmd-x</code>, copy code with <code>cmd-c</code>, and paste it with
<code>cmd-v</code> on Mac OSX, on Linux/Windows use the <code>ctrl</code> key instead.</li>
</ul>

  <h1>Terminal</h1>

<p>Every operating system comes with some kind of terminal application built in,
and they&rsquo;ll be fine to use for us.</p>

<p>A terminal is an application that doesn&rsquo;t do much more but provide a window to
run another program, called a &ldquo;shell&rdquo;. A shell is a text-based program, so it
does not have a window, and thus needs the terminal to be run on your graphical
user interface.</p>

<p>A shell is an interactive program that waits for you to type a command and hit
enter (or &ldquo;return&rdquo;). It will then run the command, display any output, and
then, again, sit and wait for you to type the next command.</p>

<p>This is how working with computers was done in early times before there was the
idea of a graphical user interface with clickable icons, windows, and a mouse as
an input device. Instead, everything was done by typing commands.</p>

<p>While this might take a little while for you to get used to, you&rsquo;ll discover
why many programmers feel that working with the shell helps them be so much
more productive and get simple things done so much quicker than using a mouse
and a graphical interface.</p>

<p>The default settings for most terminal applications that come built in to
operating systems are quite poor, unfortunately. For example the Terminal.app
on Mac OSX opens a tiny little mini window with a very small font. You want
to make the window much (much!) bigger, and find the settings to pick
a bigger font size. As a programmer, the terminal (along with your editor) is
your new home. You want to be as comfortable reading and writing in your
terminal as in any other application.</p>

<p>In case you are using Microsoft Windows it is highly recommended to use any
kind of unix based terminal. One option is Git-Bash (<a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>).
However, as Ruby and Microsoft Windows are not best friends, it is even better
to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux which is available here for
Windows 10: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10</a>. With
this option you can install everything you need for your Ruby development
under Ubuntu and use Bash as your main shell.</p>

<p>All commands in the following texts are unix commands and will not work in a
Microsoft Windows terminal.</p>

<p>Once you have started the terminal program you will see your shell&rsquo;s prompt,
and can start typing commands. You&rsquo;ll want to learn at least the command <code>cd</code>
which allows you to navigate to a particular directory (where you have stored
your code), and the command <code>ls</code> which lists the contents of a directory.</p>

<p>Also learn how to use the command line completion using <code>tab</code>: For example,
type <code>cd</code>, space, and the first two or so letters of the directory you want to
navigate to, then hit <code>tab</code>. The shell will complete the rest of the directory
name for you. If nothing happens, then there are multiple directory names
starting with the same few letters. In this case hit <code>tab</code> twice, quickly, 
and your shell will display a list of choices. Type the next letter
and hit <code>tab</code> again.</p>

  <h1>Ruby runtime</h1>

<p>The last tool you need is a Ruby runtime. This is a program that can execute
Ruby code, and it is a program that can be run in your shell (much like <code>cd</code>
and <code>ls</code>).</p>

<p>If you have some code in a file with the name <code>hello.rb</code>, and you have
navigated to the directory where the file is saved, then you can type the
following and hit enter, in order to execute the code:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>ruby hello.rb
</code></pre>

<p>This will tell the <code>ruby</code> runtime to interpret the contents of the file
<code>hello.rb</code> as Ruby code, and execute it.</p>

<p>One can also use this program to do other things. You probably won&rsquo;t need
these a lot, but we think it&rsquo;s good to know. You can try these by typing
these commands in your terminal.</p>

<p>E.g. you can print out the version of the program:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>ruby --version
</code></pre>

<p>Or execute Ruby code without storing it to a file:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>ruby -e 'puts 123'
</code></pre>

  <h1>Programming workflow</h1>

<p>In order to do programming excercises on your computer, play around with things
you learned, and write actual, useful programs you want to learn the following
workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write some code in your text editor.</li>
<li>Save the code to a file in a particular directory. The filename should end
with <code>.rb</code>.</li>
<li>Open your terminal.</li>
<li>Navigate to that directory using <code>cd</code>.</li>
<li>Execute the file using <code>ruby</code>.</li>
<li>Switch back and forth between the text editor and terminal, so you
can make small changes in your code, and then run it through <code>ruby</code> to see
what it does.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to switch back and forth between apps quickly you can use the keyboard
shortcut <code>cmd-tab</code> on Mac OSX, and <code>alt-tab</code> on Ubuntu and Windows.</p>

<p>In your shell you can use the <code>cursor up</code> key to go through your last used
commands: you don&rsquo;t have to type <code>ruby hello.rb</code> again. Just hit <code>cursor up</code>
and then enter to run it again.</p>

  <h1>Interactive Ruby</h1>

<p>One other tool that is worth mentioning, and that comes with your Ruby runtime,
is <code>irb</code>. You can start it by typing <code>irb</code> in your shell and hitting enter.</p>

<p>Its name is short for &ldquo;Interactive Ruby Shell&rdquo;, and yes, it is another kind of
shell: Just like the shell running in your terminal <code>irb</code> is also a program
that interactively waits for you to type something, and hit enter. However,
since this is a Ruby shell, it will expect that you type Ruby code instead of
system commands.</p>

<p>IRB is pretty handy for quickly trying something out, and it is a great tool
for exploring the language Ruby, and things that come built in.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hello world!"</span>
<span class="no">Hello</span> <span class="n">world!</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The first line starts the IRB program. Notice how the &ldquo;prompt&rdquo; indicator
changes. The prompt will look a little different depending on your system and
shell configuration, but often <code>$</code> is used to indicate that this is a
system shell prompt, while <code>&gt;</code> is used by IRB to indicate that this is an
interactive Ruby shell.</p>

<p>The second line is a piece of Ruby code. When you type this line and hit enter
then Ruby will execute the code, and print out the text &ldquo;Hello world!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It will then also print out the return value for this statement, which in this
case is <code>nil</code>. This is something that you can simply ignore for the time being.</p>

<p>On the last line you see IRB again waiting for input with a prompt.</p>

<p>You can exit the IRB session, and get back to your system shell, by typing
<code>exit</code> and hitting enter. Or you can also just hit <code>ctrl-d</code>, which does the
same thing.</p>

  <h1>Our Roadmap</h1>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a rough overview of the road that lies in front of us, and topics that
we&rsquo;ll cover.</p>

<p>This curriculumn is built on top of two main ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>We introduce one concept after another. Doing so we try to make sure not to
assume any knowledge but things that already were explained.</li>
<li>We get you to a point where you can create your own classes, objects, and
methods as quickly as possible: We found that&rsquo;s the point where it starts to
be most fun for most people.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course you don&rsquo;t have to follow exactly this path. For example, if you&rsquo;re
curious, after we&rsquo;ve introduced the most basic built-in types of things in
Ruby, numbers and Strings (text), you might find there&rsquo;s another chapter
about more such types. Feel free to skip ahead, and read it. Just be aware
that you might find this chapter assume a couple more things.</p>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s our roadmap:</p>

<h3>1. Object Oriented Programming</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll look at the main idea (concept, paradigm) behind programming in Ruby
from a little bit of a philosophical perspective. We do this to set a little
bit of a context for the terms <em>object</em>, <em>class</em>, and <em>method</em> which will
be used quite frequently from then on.</p>

<h3>2. Variables</h3>

<p>In order to do things with objects, and form readable sentences (code) we
need to be able to assign names to them.</p>

<p>This chapter explains variables in Ruby.</p>

<h3>3. Built-In Data Types</h3>

<p>Ruby comes with lots of batteries included. Things that are built-in, and
ready for you to be used when you open an empty Ruby file, or IRB.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll look the two most basic, and most widely used ones:</p>

<p>Numbers, and Strings (text). These will be good enough for us to introduce
other concepts without spending too much time on talking about all the other
things that Ruby has built-in (we&rsquo;ll look at the most important ones later).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll quickly mention 3 primitive things that are widely used in Ruby: <code>true</code>,
<code>false</code>, and <code>nil</code>, so you&rsquo;ve already heard of them when we come across them
later.</p>

<p>Then we discuss Arrays and Hashes, which are data structures. I.e. these are
things that you can use to store other things. They&rsquo;re pretty powerful, and
widely used.</p>

<p>Symbols are quite an odd beast, and you normally wouldn&rsquo;t even need to know
them in order to write your own, working code. However, they&rsquo;re very widely
used and many (many!) examples out there use them. So we introduce them
briefly, too.</p>

<h3>4. Objects, Classes, Methods</h3>

<p>This chapter discusses how objects and classes relate to each other, how
methods can be called on objects, and explores a number of different methods.
It also has a quick look to see what&rsquo;s up with that magic, so-called top-level
object in Ruby.</p>

<h3>5. Writing Methods</h3>

<p>While variables give names to things, methods give names to behaviour.  Methods
are like the swiss-army knife of programming.  We&rsquo;ll have a look at the anatomy
of a method, and learn how we can define our own ones.</p>

<h3>6. Writing Classes</h3>

<p>With this knowledge at hand we can now go ahead and define our first class
(kind of thing) ourselves: We&rsquo;ll define the class <code>Person</code>, create some
&ldquo;people&rdquo; (objects), and let them interact. We&rsquo;ll learn how to make our objects
&ldquo;know&rdquo; things, and how to give them &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>7. Blocks</h3>

<p>Blocks are a super powerful feature in Ruby. We love them, and use them
everywhere. Many built-in methods use them, too. So it&rsquo;s good to introduce
them now.</p>

<p>Blocks are like methods that don&rsquo;t have a name, and they are passed when
calling actual methods. We&rsquo;ll discuss why this is cool, and how it works.</p>

<h3>8. Conditionals, Truthiness, and Nothing</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to run some part of your code only if a certain condition
applies (e.g. you only want to allow users to login if the supplied password
is correct).</p>

<p>Conditionals allow you to do that. Ruby comes with some pretty cool features
included, and we&rsquo;ll quickly look at them.</p>

<h3>9. Operators</h3>

<p>There are lots of different operators built into Ruby, and at this point
you&rsquo;ve already used a number of them (such as the arithmetical operator <code>+</code>,
and the assignment operator <code>=</code>).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll look at a few more, and also reveal that operators, in fact, are &hellip;
methods in disguise!</p>

<h3>Bonus and advanced topics</h3>

<p>This concludes the core of our &ldquo;Ruby For Beginners&rdquo; curriculum. With this
knowledge you&rsquo;ll have all the tools you need in order to play with things, read
(most of) other people&rsquo;s code, and write your own useful things.</p>

<p>There are a couple bonus chapters that you might want to skim through. Some of
these are still waiting to find their place somewhere else in the book. Some
will probably be marked as optional.</p>

<p>Also there are some extra chapters about advanced topics, some of which are
relevant to the more advanced exercises, and for the next curriculum about
<a href="http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/">building your own web applications</a>.</p>

  <h1>Object-oriented programming</h1>

<p><em>Classes and objects</em></p>

<p>Ruby is, like many other popular languages, an object-oriented programming
language. Other object-oriented languages that you might have heard of are
C++, Java, Python, PHP, and Javascript. At some point in the 1990s this
paradigm started to become more and more popular and nowadays it is the
most prevalent one.</p>

<p>One reason for this is that object-oriented programming very much fits the way
we perceive and think about the world, at least in the occidental culture.
Our way of thinking was, historically, very much influenced by Plato,
and philosophers who followed him:</p>

<p>We somehow tend to think about the world as if there are abstract &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; (or
concepts) and concrete &ldquo;things&rdquo;, which are entities of the ideas, or
implementations of the concepts. So, &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; are like blueprints for &ldquo;things&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For example there&rsquo;s the idea of a human being, and then there are actual human
beings: you, and me. Our idea of a human being includes the ability to, for
example, remember our own name, and tell it to others when asked. We know
that we can ask people for their name, and they&rsquo;ll know it.</p>

<p>Now, object-oriented programming languages allow you to describe things exactly
this way: In object-oriented programming languages &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; are called classes.
And actual &ldquo;things&rdquo; are called objects.</p>

<p>As a programmer you would define classes, like a class &ldquo;User&rdquo; and a class
&ldquo;Tweet&rdquo;, and then create actual instances of these classes: an actual concrete
user with a name, email address, a password and actual tweets. You would also
define that users have the ability to remember their own name, and the ability
to tell it to others when asked.</p>

<p class="hint">
Classes are like ideas, objects are concrete things, manifestations of their ideas.
</p>

<p>Every object-oriented programming language comes with some &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;, that is,
classes, already baked in, and so does Ruby. For example Ruby has classes for
numbers, strings (text), and other useful things. You therefore can, without any
further effort, do number calculations, or text transformations.</p>

<p>In your first excercises you will do just that. Later on you will learn to
define your own &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; as classes, and then use them by the way of creating
actual instances or objects, from these classes, and then make them interact with
each other and do interesting stuff.</p>

<p>By the way, here is a quote from a book titled
<a href="http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/">The Early History Of Smalltalk</a>
from 1993. It has been written by Alan C. Kay, one of the designers of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, which was created in the
1970s, and can be considered the first fully object oriented programming
language. We think it&rsquo;s pretty interesting to read.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;[Smalltalk&rsquo;s] way of <strong>making objects</strong> is quite Platonic in that some of them act
as [&hellip;] <strong>Ideas from which manifestations can be created</strong>.
That the Ideas are themselves manifestations (of the Idea-Idea) and that the
Idea-Idea is a-kind-of Manifestation-Idea — which is a-kind-of itself, so that
the system is completely self-describing — would have been appreciated by Plato
as an extremely practical joke.&rdquo; &mdash; Alan C. Kay</em></p>

<p>Anyhow, you can take away from all of this that those universes that we create
when we write programs will be populated by objects (&ldquo;things&rdquo;), and their
characteristics are defined by classes (&ldquo;types of things&rdquo;, or &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;).</p>

<p>This will start to make a lot more sense to you once you write your own classes.</p>

<p class="hint sidenote">
There is, today, some debate about the paradigm of object-oriented
programming, and whether we should move on to another one, called &ldquo;functional
programming&rdquo;. You might hear about this if you talk to developers. Some
functional languages are Haskell, Go, and Clojure, and they have recently
started gaining some traction. Don&rsquo;t let yourself be distracted by this too
much, unless you really want to. Ruby is a very good language to start learning
programming for lots of reasons.
</p>

  <h1>Variables</h1>

<p><em>Naming things</em></p>

<p>In order to refer to the &ldquo;things&rdquo; (objects) that our program deals with we want
to assign names to them.</p>

<p>Every practical programming language has a feature to do this, called
variables. This is basically the same concept that you might know from math,
although in Ruby there are different kinds of variables (you will get to know
another one in a couple chapters).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll discuss this concept quickly because you already need to know it in the
next chapter, and the respective exercises.</p>

<p>If some of this seems rather abstract to you, don&rsquo;t fret. It will become very
practical, and you won&rsquo;t even think a lot about it any more, as soon as you
actually work with variables while learning other things.</p>

<p>Alright. Let&rsquo;s jump right in:</p>

<p>In Ruby you can assign a name to something (an object) by using the so called
assignment operator <code>=</code>. Like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will <em>assign</em> the name <code>number</code> to the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; (object) that is the number
<code>1</code>. From now on we can refer to this object by using the name <code>number</code>. For
example the following code would output the number <code>1</code>:</p>

<p class="hint">
A name on the left side of the assignment operator <code>=</code> is assigned
to the object on the right side.
</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">number</span>
</code></pre>

<p>One important thing to note here is that a variable is not a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; an object
by itself. Instead it&rsquo;s just a <em>name</em> for an actual object. In our example the
number <code>1</code> is an object, while <code>number</code> is a name for it because we&rsquo;ve assigned
it.</p>

<p class="hint">
A variable itself is not a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just a name for a thing (an object).
</p>

<p>You can think of it like a post-it note with the name <code>number</code> written on it,
and stuck on the actual thing, which is an object (in this case, a number).</p>

<p>Imagine you were in the middle of learning some Spanish, and sticked post-its
onto things in your apartment: the name <em>nevara</em> onto the refrigerator, <em>cama</em>
onto your bed, and <em>puerta del baño</em> onto the bathroom door.</p>

<p>Now, whenever you use one of these terms, as in <em>abrir la nevera</em> (open the
refrigerator) in order to learn the language and rehearse vocabulary, you&rsquo;ll
obviously refer to the object, and open its actual, physical door.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much how variable assignment works in Ruby. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;,
the object on the right side of the assignment operator <code>=</code>, and the name on
the left side is being assigned to it.</p>

<p>Whenever we use a variable name that has been defined before we refer to the
actual object that it has been assigned to. E.g. on the second line of the
code example above <code>number</code> refers to the actual object, the number <code>1</code> that
it has been assigned to on the first line. Therefore <code>puts number</code> outputs
the number.</p>

<p class="hint">
You can pick whatever variable names you want, they&rsquo;re just names, like post-it
notes stuck onto actual objects.
</p>

<p>Since names are just names, the following examples would do exactly the same:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<span class="n">large_number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">large_number</span>

<span class="n">apples</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">apples</span>
</code></pre>

<p>However, also note that it makes sense to try and pick names that reveal your
intention. The chapter <a href="/bonus/good_names.html">Using the right
words</a> at the end of this book will talk more about this. Feel free to jump
ahead if you are curious. In short, the first example using <code>a</code> as a name would
be frowned upon because it&rsquo;s wasting the opportunity to use a meaningful name.
The second and third examples are just trying to be stupid, and pick names that
don&rsquo;t match the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; (the object, number <code>1</code>) at all.</p>

<p>There are a two more things about variable assignments that we&rsquo;d like to
point out before we move on.</p>

  <h1>Reusing variable names</h1>

<p>It is also important to keep in mind that a name is unique, in the sense that
the same name can only be assigned to one value (object) at a time.</p>

<p>In other words, if you assign different values to the same variable, then
assignments that happen later will simply overwrite previous ones. Like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This, again, would output <code>14</code>.</p>

<p class="hint">
Variable names can be re-used, and re-assigned.
</p>

<p>The first line assigns the name <code>number</code> to the number <code>4</code>. The second line
re-assigns it to another object.</p>

<p>Getting back to our post-its metaphor &hellip; this would stick a post-it with the
name <code>number</code> on one thing, and then later take it off of it, and stick it on
something else.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at it under the microscope:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the <strong>first line</strong> Ruby creates the number (object) <code>4</code>.</li>
<li>It then assigns the name <code>number</code> to it (sticks a post-it onto it).</li>
<li>On the <strong>second line</strong>, Ruby first looks at the stuff on the right side,
and evaluates the expression <code>number * 3</code>. Doing so it will create
the number (object) <code>3</code> and multiply it with the object that currently has
the name <code>number</code>, which is <code>4</code>. This operation results in a new number
(object) <code>12</code>.</li>
<li>Now Ruby is finally ready to stick the name <code>number</code> on the result <code>12</code>.
I.e. <em>from now on</em> the name <code>number</code> refers to a different object, which is
<code>12</code>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>third line</strong> Ruby will, again, first look at the expression <code>number + 2</code>
on the right. It creates the object <code>2</code> and adds it to the object that currently
has the name <code>number</code>. This results in a new number (object) <code>14</code>.</li>
<li>Finally Ruby passes this object <code>14</code> to <code>puts</code>, which outputs it to the
screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, you would probably never actually write this exact code in practice
since you can simply do all this in just one line instead: <code>puts 4 * 3 + 2</code>.</p>

<p>However, sometimes you&rsquo;ll find or write code that assigns an initial value to a
variable, and then keeps working on it for a few more lines. This sometimes is
useful to break up long lines, and make code more readable.</p>

<p class="hint">
Using variable names can be useful to break up long lines and make code more
expressive and readable.
</p>

<p>Also, Ruby has different kinds of variables.</p>

<p>The kind of variable that we&rsquo;ve introduced so far is called a <em>local variable</em>,
and it&rsquo;s the one used most often. You will learn about another type of
variables later when we talk about classes and objects.</p>

<p class="hint formatting">
On formatting: Note that there are spaces around the assignment operator `=`
as well as the arithmetical operators `+` and `*`.
</p>

  <h1>Things on the right go first</h1>

<p>One last thing that is worth mentioning about variables:</p>

<p>Just as in traffic (well, at least in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-_and_left-hand_traffic">most parts of the world</a>),
things on the right side go first :)</p>

<p>For a variable assignment, in order to assign the thing on the right side to
the name on the left side, Ruby first needs to figure out the thing on the
right. As you will see later the same is true for many other expressions in
Ruby.</p>

<p>In our example above it will first create the object that is the number <code>1</code>,
and then assign it to the name <code>number</code>. The following example makes that more
clear:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">number</span>
</code></pre>

<p>When Ruby looks at the first line <code>number = 2 + 3 * 4</code> it notices that this is
using the assignment operator <code>=</code>. Therefor, before it can assign the name
<code>number</code> to the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; (object) on the right &hellip; it first needs to know what
that thing is.</p>

<p>So, before she does anything else, Ruby will first look at the expression <code>2 +
3 * 4</code>, which will result in the number (object) <code>14</code>. She will <em>then</em> assign
the name <code>number</code> to this object (i.e. evaluate the assignment operator <code>=</code>).</p>

<p>You can imagine that in this moment, when Ruby starts evaluating the assignment
<code>=</code> the code temporarily looks like this: <code>number = 14</code> (because the
calculation has returned the number <code>14</code>).</p>

<p>Does this make sense?</p>

<p>Again, on the second line Ruby will then pass the thing with the name <code>number</code>
(which is <code>14</code>) to <code>puts</code>, which will output it to the screen.</p>

<p class="hint">
Ruby evaluates the expression on the right first.
</p>

  <h1>Built-In Data Types</h1>

<p>As mentioned before, Ruby comes with lots of things already baked in, and
provides you with tons of tools to use and hit the road running.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll look at some of the most common data types in Ruby. Data types are types
of &ldquo;things&rdquo; that are mainly used to represent data, such as numbers, text, and
other values.</p>

<p>This is basically the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that you, as a Ruby programmers will work with,
when we work with actual data, that is interesting to you, or your users in one
way or the other.</p>

<p>We will discusss the following data types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>Strings (texts)</li>
<li>True, False, and Nil</li>
<li>Symbols</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Hashes</li>
</ul>

<p>These &ldquo;kinds of things&rdquo; (objects) cover like 98% of all built-in data types
that you&rsquo;ll be using on a day to day basis, i.e. these are being used all over
the place. There are more data types, but those are rather exotic, and used
much less often.</p>

<p>Numbers and Strings (which is just a strange name for &ldquo;texts&rdquo;) are some of the
most basic &ldquo;things&rdquo; that you deal with in Ruby on a regular basis. The are also
just enough lego bricks for us to dive into more interesting topics, such as
how objects, classes, and methods relate to each other, and how you can create
your own ones.</p>

<p>Before we do so we will also briefly mention the &ldquo;things&rdquo; <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and
<code>nil</code>, just because these are things that we&rsquo;ll come across along the way
anyway.</p>

<p>Symbols also are very commonly used, but quite an odd concept. You normally
wouldn&rsquo;t need to understand Symbols in order to write your own code. We&rsquo;ll
still cover them briefly, and use them once in a while, just in case you find
them elsewhere.</p>

<p>Arrays and Hashes are &ldquo;things&rdquo; (objects) that are used to store other things,
and they&rsquo;re super useful, and widely used.</p>

  <h1>Numbers</h1>

<p>Numbers are simply numbers.</p>

<p>You can create one by writing it: <code>123</code> is Ruby code and it represents the
number one-hundred-twenty-three.</p>

<p>Negative numbers are created by prepending a minus <code>-</code>: This is the number
minus-ninety-nine: <code>-99</code>.</p>

<p>And of course there are decimal numbers, too. Again, you create one by writing
it: <code>12.34</code>.</p>

<p>You can also use an underscore to separate thousands places: E.g. <code>1_234.56</code> is the
number one-thousand-two-hundred-thirty-four-point-five-six.  However, this is
optional. This is the exact same number in Ruby: <code>1234.56</code>.</p>

<p class="hint">
A number is defined by a series of digits, using a dot as a decimal mark, and
optinally an underscore as a thousands separator.
</p>

<p>Note that different countries use different punctuation for decimal and
thousands separators. Ruby is using the same notation used in the USA, which
happens to be the exact opposite of what&rsquo;s used in Germany.</p>

<h2>Kinds of numbers</h2>

<p>Under the hood, for reasons that are mostly technical, there are actually
different kinds of numbers:</p>

<p>For example there are integer numbers (those without a fraction, i.e. a dot and
decimal places), and depending on their size there are two kinds of them. For
floating point numbers there are even more. Unless you are super curious, you
can perfectly ignore all of that for now, and just think of numbers as numbers.</p>

<p>However, when you do calculations with numbers, keep in mind that integer
numbers (&ldquo;integers&rdquo;) and decimal point numbers (floating point numbers, aka
&ldquo;floats&rdquo;) are different.</p>

<p>If you do a calculation that uses integer number you&rsquo;ll always
get an integer back:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</code></pre>

<p>However, if any of the numbers involved is a float, then you&rsquo;ll get a float back:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre>

<p class="hint">
Mathematical operations result in a floating point number except if all numbers used are integer numbers.
</p>

<p>This is, for example, important when you do a division (<code>/</code> means &ldquo;divide by&rdquo;):</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see any decimal places will be just cut off, since the result needs
to be an integer number.</p>

<p>However, if you use floats:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span>
</code></pre>

<p class="hint">
Use floating point (decimal) numbers when doing devisions.

  <h1>Strings</h1>

<p>A String, in programming languages, is text.</p>

<p>More precisely a String is an object that represents a specific text. E.g. your
name, represented in Ruby, is one String. The title of this text is another
String, and so is this paragraph, and this full text in its entirety.</p>

<p>In web applications Strings are everywhere. In fact they&rsquo;re used by far more
often than numbers. That probably is because most applications that we deal
with on a daily basis are dealing with text messages (Email, Facebook, Twitter,
&hellip;) or descriptions of things (Amazon, Ebay, &hellip;).</p>

<p>Did you ever use a web application that is a complicated calculator app, and
mostly deals with numbers? There you go :)</p>

<p>In Ruby there are a couple of flexible ways to create Strings, but the most simple
and by far most common way is to simply enclose some characters in quotes:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="s2">"This is one String!"</span>
<span class="s1">'And this is another one.'</span>
</code></pre>

<p class="hint">
Strings can be defined by enclosing any text with single or double quotes.
</p>

<p>Both of these are good to use. Technically they are <em>almost</em> the same, except
for one important feature called &ldquo;String interpolation&rdquo;, which we&rsquo;ll <a href="../bonus/string_interpolation.html">explain
later</a>.</p>

<h3>Things you can do with Strings</h3>

<p>Here are a few things you can do with Strings.</p>

<p>You can glue them together by using <code>+</code>. We also call this
<a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Concatenation">concatenation</a>.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"snow"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"ball"</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"snowball"</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"hi"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"hi"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"hi"</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"hihihi"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The last operation can also be done by using <code>*</code>, like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"hi"</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"hihihi"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>I.e. multiplying a String by a number in Ruby means repeating the String as
many times.</p>

<p>The following examples are worth noting, too:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"1"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"1"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"1"</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"111"</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"1"</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"111"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates that Ruby behaves the same for Strings that contain nothing
but numbers.</p>

<p>Some other things that you can do with Strings that you can try yourself in
<code>irb</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">upcase</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"HELLO"</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">capitalize</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Hello"</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">5</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">reverse</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"olleh"</span>
</code></pre>

<p class="hint">
These last few examples are examples of &ldquo;calling methods on objects that are Strings&rdquo;.
Methods are &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo; that objects are capable of. We&rsquo;ll explain methods, and how
they relate to objects more in just a few chapters.
</p>

<p>Exercises: How about doing some of the <a href="../exercises/strings.html">exercises on Strings</a>
next?</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The reason why pieces of text, in the context of programming languages, usually
are not referred to as &ldquo;text&rdquo;, but instead with the slightly odd term &ldquo;String&rdquo;
is a historical, and technical one:</p>

<p>In early programming languages Strings were implemented as lists of characters,
and programmers had to deal with them as such: imagine pellets lined up on a
String. One had to take care of nasty things like manually managing the length
of the character list, and inserting a couple characters in the middle of such
a list was quite a complicated operation.</p>

<p>When languages evolved over time they made things like this easier for
developers, and added built-in abstractions for the concept of &ldquo;Strings&rdquo;.
So the name sticked, and resembles the way programmers had thought about text
before: as characters lined up on Strings.</p>

<p class="hint">
Luckily, nowadays, in Ruby and any other modern language, you can just think
about Strings as text.
</p>

  <h1>True, False, and Nil</h1>

<p>There are three more &ldquo;things&rdquo; that we&rsquo;d like to mention quickly, just because
you&rsquo;ll see quite frequently: These are <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>The first two, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are just what you think they are:</p>

<p class="hint">
The object <code>true</code> represents &ldquo;truth&rdquo;, while <code>false</code>
represents the opposite of it.
</p>

<p>In other words, in Ruby, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are also &ldquo;things&rdquo;, just like
numbers, Strings, Arrays, and Hashes. You can assign them to variables, pass
them around, and otherwise use them. They&rsquo;re fairly simple things, but they&rsquo;re
also very useful.</p>

<p>The third object <code>nil</code> represents &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. In Ruby
there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that represents the absence of things. This might be a
interesting topic to discuss on a philosophical level, but for now we&rsquo;ll
just see how it works in Ruby.</p>

<p class="hint">
The object <code>nil</code> represents &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see later that every operation (&ldquo;method&rdquo;) in Ruby always returns
exactly one thing (i.e. one object), and that&rsquo;s why there needs to be a
&ldquo;thing&rdquo; that represents &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This will start to feel pretty natural to you pretty soon.</p>

  <h1>Symbols</h1>

<p><em>Symbols are like strings, except they are code.</em></p>

<p>Symbols are a rather strange concept to be honest, and we only introduce them
because symbols are used so often and widely that you&rsquo;ll very likely find them
used in code elsewhere. For your first steps in learning programming we would
not necessarily need them.</p>

<p>A symbol is written like this: <code>:something</code></p>

<p>I.e. there is a word that is preceded by a colon. This means that normally
symbols do not contain spaces. Instead, if we have symbols that consist of
multiple words we would concatenate them with underscores, like so:
<code>:another_funny_symbol</code></p>

<p class="hint">
A symbol is created by adding a colon in front of a word.
</p>

<p>So when to use strings, and when to use symbols?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s actually no perfectly clear line or simple definition.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One rule of thumb is that if the text at hand is &ldquo;data&rdquo;, then use a string.
If it&rsquo;s <em>code</em>, then use a symbol, especially when used as keys in hashes (see
below).</p></li>
<li><p>Another way of looking at symbols is that they aren&rsquo;t really text, even though
they read well. Instead they are <em>unique identifiers</em>, like numbers, or bar
codes. While strings represent data that can change, symbols represent unique
values, which are static.</p></li>
<li><p>And more technically, if you use strings that contain the same text in your
code multiple times, then a new string object will be created every time. E.g.
if you do <code>puts &quot;Hello!&quot;</code> 10 times then 10 actual string objects will be
created (and then discarded, because they&rsquo;re not being used any longer). On the
other hand, if you&rsquo;d use a symbol for this and do <code>puts :hello</code> 10 times, then
only <em>one single object</em> will be created, and <em>re-used</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="hint">
Symbols are unique identifiers that are considered code, not data.
</p>

<p>If you find all of this confusing, don&rsquo;t worry, many people do. You&rsquo;ll
understand symbols better once you get to use some of them in your code. For
now you can think of them as a special, limited variation of Strings (text).</p>

<p class="hint">
Symbols are a special, limited variation of Strings.
</p>

<h2>The technical difference</h2>

<p>Skip the following unless you&rsquo;re really curious about the underlying technical
difference between Strings and Symbols.</p>

<p>Try this in IRB:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"a string"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">object_id</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">70358630335100</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"a string"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">object_id</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">70358640625960</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"a string"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">object_id</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">70358644379620</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, even though the 3 Strings created are exactly the same, every
new String created has a different <code>object_id</code>: They&rsquo;re actually different
objects, even though they contain the same text.</p>

<p>With Symbols however:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:a_symbol</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">object_id</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1086748</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:a_symbol</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">object_id</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1086748</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:a_symbol</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">object_id</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1086748</span>
</code></pre>

<p>We now get the same <code>object_id</code> for each of the Symbols, meaning they&rsquo;re
referring to the exact same object.</p>

<p>The <code>object_id</code> is a unique id that Ruby uses internally in order to keep track
of all the objects that are flying around in the universe that makes up your
program. E.g. Ruby needs to know which objects are still being useful, and
which ones can be cleaned up and thrown away. The <code>object_id</code> is a way to
identify each and any object by a unique id.</p>

<p>By <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>nil</code> (as well as all numbers) also behave this way:
Whenever you use these in your code you&rsquo;ll get the same object. Try it in IRB
and check their <code>object_id</code>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move on though.</p>

  <h1>Arrays</h1>

<p><em>Arrays are like bags that contain things</em></p>

<p>While numbers, Strings, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>nil</code> all represent simple,
primitive things, Arrays are more interesting, and very useful.</p>

<p>Arrays are things that store (or &ldquo;hold&rdquo;) other things. You can think of an
Array as a collection or list of things. Or better yet, as a bag that you can
throw things in: <em>The bag itself is a thing (an object), too</em>.</p>

<p class="hint">
An Array is an object that stores other objects.
</p>

<p>An Array is created by separating values by commas, and enclosing this list
with square brackets, like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This is a simple Array that holds three numbers.</p>

<p class="hint">
An Array is created by listing objects, separated by commas, and enclosed by square brackets.
</p>

<p>Arrays can contain all kinds of things:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"A string"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:symbol</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This creates an Array with 5 elements, i.e. a bag that contains 5 things: a
string, a number, <code>true</code>, a symbol, and another number.</p>

<p class="hint">
Arrays can contain all kinds of objects.
</p>

<p>Note that in Ruby Arrays always keep their order: Unlike a real bag, where,
when you throw in a bunch of apples, they might come out in a different order,
an Array always keeps its objects in the same defined order (unless you do
something to change the order).</p>

<p>Also note that in Ruby you can store any kind of object in an Array. For
example, you can also store Arrays in an Array: that&rsquo;s a 2-dimensional Array,
like a table that has many rows, and each row has many cells (&ldquo;things&rdquo;).</p>

<p class="hint">
Arrays have a defined order, and can store all kinds of objects.
</p>

<h2>Retrieving an element from an Array</h2>

<p>Arrays can be used in a lot of different, and useful ways, but the most basic
one is to retrieve a certain element by the way of referring to its position:
<em>Please get me the element at position 1!</em></p>

<p>In Ruby, you can do this with square brackets like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">words</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"one"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"three"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">words</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Do you recognize how we use a <a href="../variables.html">variable</a> to assign a name
to our Array here?</p>

<p><code>words[1]</code> means: from the Array <code>words</code> get the element at position
<code>1</code>. <code>puts</code> will then print this value out to the screen. (By the way<code>puts</code>
stands for &ldquo;(out-) put string&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>So, as you can see square brackets <code>[]</code> mean different things when used in
different contexts. The same is true for other punctuation, too.</p>

<p>In our case here the square brackets on the first line are used to create an
Array object with the given elements. On the second line the square brackets
are now appended to a variable name. This means we want look up an element from
the Array that (at this moment) is called <code>words</code> (i.e. assigned to the
variable <code>words</code>).</p>

<p class="hint">
Punctuation (such as square brackets) has different meanings in different contexts.
</p>

<h2>Arrays are zero based</h2>

<p>What do you think our example code will print out to the terminal? Funnily,
it&rsquo;s <code>two</code>, and not <code>one</code>. Huh?</p>

<p>The reason for this is: The first position in an Array is 0, not 1. So the
position 1 refers to the second element, not the first one.</p>

<p>In programming books and the Ruby documentation you&rsquo;ll often find the word
&ldquo;index&rdquo; to be used instead of &ldquo;position&rdquo; in this context.</p>

<p class="hint">
Arrays start with the index 0, not 1.
</p>

<h2>Appending an element to an Array</h2>

<p>In order to add an element to the end of an existing Array you can use the
operator <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, called &ldquo;shovel operator&rdquo;, like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">words</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"one"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"three"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">words</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="s2">"four"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">words</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This prints out <code>four</code>: The string <code>&quot;four&quot;</code> has been &ldquo;shoveled&rdquo; into, that
means, appended to the Array. And since it now sits at position <code>3</code> we can
access it using <code>words[3]</code>.</p>

<h2>Setting an element to a position</h2>

<p>You can also set an element to a specific index, like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">words</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"one"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"three"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">words</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"four"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">words</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This also prints out <code>four</code>.</p>

<p>You could also overwrite existing elements the same way. For example this
would set the word <code>&quot;uno&quot;</code> to the position <code>0</code> (i.e. overwrite <code>&quot;one&quot;</code>):</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">words</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"one"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"three"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">words</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"uno"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">words</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So, this would now output <code>uno</code>.</p>

<p class="hint formatting">
On formatting: Note that there are no spaces inside the square brackets,
and there&rsquo;s one space after each comma.
</p>

<h2>Missing elements</h2>

<p>What if we try to retrieve an element that does not exist, for example
the element at the fourth, or fifth position (index)?</p>

<p>Right, we get back <code>nil</code>, meaning &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">words</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"one"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"three"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">words</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">words</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll learn later that every operation (&ldquo;method&rdquo;) in Ruby always
<a href="../writing_methods/return_values.html">returns exactly one thing</a>
(i.e. one object), and that&rsquo;s why there needs to be a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that represents
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This will start to feel pretty natural to you pretty soon.</p>

<h2>Nested Arrays</h2>

<p>As said before, Arrays can contain all sorts of things. So, they can also
contain more Arrays.</p>

<p>This is quite a common thing to use when you need to represent some data that
has the characteristics of a table, like an spreadsheet.</p>

<p>The outer Array represents the table, and each inner Array represents one
row. Each value then represents a cell. For example:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">],</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This is a nested Array that represents the structure of number keys on a phone.</p>

<h2>Things you can do with Arrays</h2>

<p>Here are a few things you can do with Arrays.</p>

<p>Look at them, and play with them in <code>irb</code>. Don&rsquo;t necessarily try to memorize
all of them &hellip; you can always look things up in the documentation when you
actually need these. It might be useful if you&rsquo;ve seen some of them before
though.</p>

<p>Funnily, you can &ldquo;calculate&rdquo; with Arrays. Remember set theory from your math
classes? This is pretty similar.</p>

<p>You can add Arrays:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Subtract them from each other:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:one</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:three</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:four</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:three</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:four</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:one</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Multiply with a number:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"Ruby"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Monstas"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"Ruby"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Monstas"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Monstas"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Monstas"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And find the intersection:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p><code>first</code> and <code>last</code> are alternative ways to retrieve the first and last element:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">first</span>
<span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">last</span>
<span class="mi">3</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Some other things that you can do with Arrays that you can try yourself in
<code>irb</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">length</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">sort</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">compact</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">rotate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">]].</span><span class="nf">transpose</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In these examples <code>compact</code> removes all <code>nil</code> values from the Array.
<code>transpose</code> works with a nested Array and &ldquo;flips&rdquo; the table, i.e. turns columns
into rows, and rows into columns.</p>

<p>Exercises: Now would be a good time to do some of the <a href="../exercises/arrays_1.html">exercises on
Arrays</a>.</p>

  <h1>Hashes</h1>

<p><em>Dictionaries: look up one thing by another</em></p>

<p>Hashes are another very useful, and widely used kind of thing that can be used
to store other objects.</p>

<p>Unlike arrays which are mere lists, Hashes are like dictionaries:</p>

<p>You can use them to look up one thing by another thing. We say: we look up a
value from a Hash using a key. Or one could say: <em>Please get me the value that
is associated with this key.</em></p>

<p>Imagine a real dictionary that translates from English to German. When you
look up the English word &ldquo;hello&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ll find the German &ldquo;Hallo&rdquo;. When
you look up &ldquo;one&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;eins&rdquo;, and so on. The authors of this
dictionary have assigned a German word (a value) to an English word (the key).</p>

<p>Hashes work pretty much like this.</p>

<p class="hint">
A Hash assigns values to keys, so that values can be looked up by their key.
</p>

<p>We also refer to a value that is assigned to a key as <em>key/value pairs</em>. A
Hash can have as many key/value pairs as you like.</p>

<h2>Creating a Hash</h2>

<p>In Ruby you can create a Hash by assigning a key to a value with <code>=&gt;</code>, separate
these key/value pairs with commas, and enclose the whole thing with curly
braces.</p>

<p>This is how it looks:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"three"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This defines a Hash that contains 3 key/value pairs, meaning that we can look
up three values (the strings <code>&quot;eins&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;zwei&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;drei&quot;</code>) using three
different keys (the strings <code>&quot;one&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;two&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;three&quot;</code>).</p>

<p>By the way, the Ruby community has come up with the name <em>hash rocket</em> for the
bit of syntax <code>=&gt;</code> which separates a key from a value, &hellip; we think that is
pretty cool to know :)</p>

<p class="hint">
A Hash is created by listing key/value pairs, separated by hash rockets, and enclosed by curly braces.
</p>

<h2>Looking up a value</h2>

<p>Now, how do you actually look up the value that is associated with the key
<code>&quot;one&quot;</code>?</p>

<p>Just like with Arrays you use sqare brackets, but instead of passing
a number indicating the position you now pass the key. Like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"three"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"one"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Do you reckognize how we, on the second line, use a variable name to
refer to the Hash defined on the first line?</p>

<p>In this example, <code>dictionary</code> is a Hash defined on the first line. <code>[&quot;one&quot;]</code>
looks up the value associated to the key <code>&quot;one&quot;</code>, which is <code>&quot;eins&quot;</code>. This value
will be passed to <code>puts</code> which outputs it to the screen.</p>

<h2>Setting a key to a value</h2>

<p>Also, just like with Arrays, there&rsquo;s a way to set key/value pairs on an existing
Hash:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"three"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"zero"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"null"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"zero"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This prints out <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>You could also overwrite existing key/values the same way. For example this
would set the word <code>&quot;uno&quot;</code> to the key <code>&quot;one&quot;</code> (i.e. overwrite the existing pair
with the value <code>&quot;eins&quot;</code>):</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"three"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"one"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"uno"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"one"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So, this would now output <code>uno</code>.</p>

<h2>Any kind of objects</h2>

<p>You can use any kind of object as keys, and you can store any kind of object
as values.</p>

<p>For example, these are all valid Hashes, too:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">{</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:one</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:three</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"weights"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"pound"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"kilogram"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="s2">"lengths"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"meter"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"mile"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:de</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:one</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:three</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The first example uses numbers as keys, while the second one uses Symbols,
which is quite a common thing to do in Ruby.</p>

<p>In the third example you can see that one can use Arrays as values in Hashes.
So if you&rsquo;d look up the key <code>&quot;weights&quot;</code> you&rsquo;d now get an Array back.</p>

<p>Not quite sure where you&rsquo;d use a Hash like the third line in real code, but the
last line is actually pretty darn close to what Rails uses for translating
strings to different languages:</p>

<p>It is also an example of a nested Hash. There&rsquo;s another Hash associated
(stored) as a value for the key <code>:de</code> (representing the language German). And
this other Hash now has three key/value pairs. So a Rails programmer could look
up how to translate &ldquo;one&rdquo; to German, and get &ldquo;eins&rdquo; back.</p>

<p class="hint">
Hashes can use any kind of objects as keys and values.
</p>

<p class="hint formatting">
On formatting: Note that there&rsquo;s one space inside the curly braces on both
sides, around the <code>=></code> Hash rocket, and after each comma. But there
are, again, no spaces inside that square brackets <code>[]</code> that define
the Arrays on the third line.
</p>

<h2>Missing values</h2>

<p>What happens if we try to look up a key that does not exist?</p>

<p>Again, just as with Arrays, we&rsquo;ll get back <code>nil</code>, meaning &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"three"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"four"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Does this make sense?</p>

<h2>Things you can do with Hashes</h2>

<p>The main purpose of a Hash is being able to lookup a value by a key.</p>

<p>However, here are a few other things you can do with Hashes, too.</p>

<p>Again, look at them, and play with them in <code>irb</code>. Don&rsquo;t necessarily put too
much effort into memorizing all of them &hellip;</p>

<p>You can merge two Hashes:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span> <span class="p">}.</span><span class="nf">merge</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span> <span class="p">})</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p><code>fetch</code> does just the same as the square bracket lookup <code>[]</code> discussed before,
but it will raise an error if the key is not defined:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">fetch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"one"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">fetch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"two"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="no">KeyError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">key</span> <span class="n">not</span> <span class="ss">found: </span><span class="s2">"two"</span>
</code></pre>

<p><code>keys</code> returns an Array with all the keys that a Hash knows:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">keys</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"one"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p><code>length</code> and <code>size</code> both tell how many key/value pairs the Hash has:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"two"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">size</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Hash syntax confusion</h2>

<p>You can skip the following and jump right to the chapter <a href="../variables.html">Variables</a>,
or you can keep reading if you&rsquo;re curious.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s important for us to explain the following somewhere in our
book, because many online resources use another, alternative syntax for
defining Hashes.</p>

<p>The term <em>syntax</em>, in programming, refers to ways to use punctuation in order
to (amongst other things) create objects.</p>

<p>E.g. the fact that we can use square brackets <code>[]</code> and commas <code>,</code> in order to
define Arrays, and curly braces <code>{}</code> and hash rockets <code>=&gt;</code> in order to define
Hashes, is part of Ruby&rsquo;s <em>syntax</em>.</p>

<p>Today, there are two different syntaxes for defining Hashes with curly braces,
and they have the potential to confuse newcomers a lot.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an old-style one, and a new, modern one.</p>

<p class="hint">
We use the old syntax, and ignore the new one, for now.
</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s why:</p>

<p>Up to a certain version of Ruby the syntax that uses hash rockets was the only
syntax to create Hashes, and it works the same for all Hashes no matter what
kinds of objects you use as keys.</p>

<p>Then, a few years back, a new syntax was introduced. Many Ruby programmers love
to use it, because it takes a little less space, and it also looks a lot like
JSON, which is a data format that is widely used in web applications.</p>

<p>The new Hash syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">one: </span><span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">two: </span><span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">three: </span><span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Using this syntax we tell Ruby that we want the keys to be symbols.</p>

<p>Hmmmm? We just learned that Symbols are defined by prepending a word with a
colon like <code>:one</code>, right?</p>

<p>Well, yes, correct, but that&rsquo;s just how it works: If you define a Hash using
this syntax, then you&rsquo;ll get <em>a Hash that has Symbols as keys</em>.</p>

<p>We found the new syntax pretty confusing for beginners: It is slightly less
explicit and obvious, and you have to learn another piece of information.
That&rsquo;s why we simply ignore it in our study groups while we learn what Hashes
are and how you can use them.</p>

<p>Once you feel comfortable using Hashes, you can make your own decision, and
start using the modern syntax if you like it better.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, whenever you see a Hash using the new syntax somewhere else,
you now know what it means, and where to look it up. Simply remember that these
two Hashes are exactly the same:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:one</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:three</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">one: </span><span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">two: </span><span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">three: </span><span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

  <h1>Objects, Classes, Methods</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about objects quite a bit now, merely <em>using</em> that term as a
synomym for &ldquo;things&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ve learned to do stuff with simple objects such as
numbers and Strings, and the data structures Arrays and Hashes. You&rsquo;ve also
learned what a method is, how to define and use them, and how to pass things to
them, and get others back.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re also prepared well enough to have a closer look at objects, classes
(types of things) and methods, and how they relate to each other.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, you may have heard the following. Rubyist love saying it:</p>

<p class="hint">
In Ruby everything is an object.
</p>

<p>Actually, this is a little bit of a lie. Even though it&rsquo;s being said so often,
it isn&rsquo;t completely true: not <em>everything</em> is an object. There are a few things
that are not objects.</p>

<p>But almost everything is, and that&rsquo;s good enough to know for now.</p>

<p class="hint">
In Ruby almost everything is an object :)
</p>

<p>(Just in case you want to out-smart people at your local Ruby user group
though, remember to ask &ldquo;Really? Is an <a href="conditionals.html">if</a> statement an
object or a method?  How about <a href="writing_classes/self.html">self</a>?&rdquo;)</p>

  <h1>Objects have classes</h1>

<p>As mentioned <a href="../object_oriented_programming.html">before</a> when you run a Ruby
program a little universe (space, scope) is being created, and populated with
concrete objects (things) as defined by your program. These things interact,
and do useful stuff, using certain methods that you call.</p>

<p>Also, each concrete thing (object) is an instance of a general idea or type,
and these ideas are called <em>classes</em>.</p>

<p>You can see that objects have classes when you open IRB in your terminal and
ask an object for its class:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"this is a string"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">class</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">String</span>
</code></pre>

<p class="note">
Objects are concrete instances (manifestations) of classes.
</p>

<p>That means that the following sentence is true: In Ruby, <code>&quot;a string&quot;</code> <em>is a</em>
<code>String</code>.</p>

<p>Hmmmm, yeah, we kinda knew that already, right. However, you can also ask the
same question in Ruby:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"this is a string"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">is_a?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">String</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So, the actual string knows that it <em>is a</em> <code>String</code>, which in Ruby means that
it is an instance of the class <code>String</code>. You can do this for any object. E.g.
<code>1.is_a?(Numeric)</code>, also returns <code>true</code>. This is pretty cool.</p>

<p>We also say that an object is an <em>instance</em> of its class. Let&rsquo;s see what that
means.</p>

  <h1>Classes create objects</h1>

<p><em>Objects are instances of classes.</em></p>

<p>Classes are kind of blue prints for the concrete objects. Every time a concrete
object (such as the String <code>&quot;one string&quot;</code>, the String <code>&quot;another string&quot;</code>, the
String <code>&quot;yet another string&quot;</code>, and so on &hellip;) is created:</p>

<p>We say that the class is <em>instantiated</em>: an object is created from it.</p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>Classes have a bunch of characteristics, but most importantly, every class
defines a number of methods, which are specific to this type of thing (e.g. a
String).</p>

<p>Now, every time a new object is created (&ldquo;instantiated&rdquo;) from this class this
new object get (&ldquo;inherits&rdquo;) all of these methods.</p>

<p class="note">
Objects inherit methods from their classes.
</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. Objects have their own methods attached to them.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll explain more about methods that belong to objects in the next chapter.
And you&rsquo;ll see how you can define methods to your own classes, so they&rsquo;re then
available on your objects when we start defining our
<a href="/writing_classes">first, own class</a>.</p>

<p>But for now we can already point out that all concrete Strings that you use in
your code will all have the same methods defined (attached to them) &hellip; because
they&rsquo;re all created (instantiated) from the the same class.</p>

<p>You can have a look at all the methods that the class <code>String</code> defines on
Ruby&rsquo;s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html">documentation page</a> for this
class.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how we can use these methods.</p>

  <h1>Objects have methods</h1>

<p><em>Methods are an object&rsquo;s behaviour</em></p>

<p>Objects have methods, allowing us to do interesting stuff with them. An
object&rsquo;s methods are things that the object can <em>do</em>.</p>

<p>Think about a person, like, a friend of yours. You can ask this person for
their name (call a method), and they&rsquo;ll tell you (return it to you). Their name
is a piece of knowledge that this person has, and the ability to tell it to you
(respond to your question) is a piece of behaviour (a method) they have.</p>

<p>We could also ask them to make, and bring a cup of tea for us. Or we could ask
them to remember a phone number, or email password.</p>

<p>As Rubyists we actually say that we &ldquo;talk to objects&rdquo;, or &ldquo;send messages&rdquo; to
them: We do so by using (calling) methods that they respond to.</p>

<p>So, what can an object do?</p>

<p>That depends on their class (type). Numbers can do things that are useful for
numbers, obviously. You can do math, and ask them about their mathematical
properties (e.g. &ldquo;Are you an odd number?&rdquo;). Strings (text) come with way more
methods, and they&rsquo;re often related to text transformations.</p>

<p class="hint">
Methods add behaviour that is useful to have for a particular type of object.
</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve already used some methods in the previous chapters: E.g. <code>&quot;hello&quot;.upcase</code>
calls the method <code>upcase</code> on the String <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Also, <code>class</code> and <code>is_a?</code> are methods defined on all objects in Ruby, and
therefore also defined on the String <code>&quot;a string&quot;</code>: <code>&quot;a string&quot;.is_a?(String)</code>
answers with <code>true</code>.</p>

<p class="hint">
Some methods, such as <code>class</code>, <code>is_a?</code>, are defined on all objects.
</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to see how we can use (call) these methods though.</p>

  <h1>Calling methods</h1>

<p>In Ruby, methods that belong to (are defined on) objects can be used (called)
by adding a dot, and then the method name, like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">method</span>
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s like saying <em>Hey object, please do [method]</em>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try that out in IRB.</p>

<p>For example, the class <code>String</code> defines methods like <code>upcase</code> (<em>Give me an
uppercase version of yours</em>), <code>downcase</code> (<em>What&rsquo;s the downcased version of
yours</em>), and <code>length</code> (<em>Hey string, what&rsquo;s your length?</em>).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how we can call them:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby Monstas"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">upcase</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"RUBY MONSTAS"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">downcase</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"ruby monstas"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">12</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>In other words, you first address, or mention, the object that you want to talk
to, and then, with the dot <code>.</code>, &ldquo;send a message&rdquo; to the object by specifying
the method name. We also say: &ldquo;you call the method upcase on the string&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="hint">
A dot is used to call a method on an object.
</p>

<p>Imagine the string <code>name</code> is a person you can talk to. You can ask questions by
&ldquo;sending a message&rdquo; to them, and they&rsquo;ll respond by sending (returning)
something back. The term &ldquo;sending messages&rdquo; actually is used instead of
&ldquo;calling a method&rdquo; in programming, and specifically in Ruby.</p>

<p>So, you can ask the string to hand you an &ldquo;upcased&rdquo; version of itself. And
it responds by doing so. Or you can ask it for its length, and it responds
by returning the number <code>12</code> to you.</p>

<p>You can have a look at all the methods that the class <code>String</code> defines
(responds to) on Ruby&rsquo;s
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html">documentation page for this class</a>.</p>

<p>Most methods in Ruby work this way: You ask an object to return a bit of
information about itself (such as a String&rsquo;s length), or a modified
(transformed) version of itself (such as a downcased version of the String).</p>

<p class="hint">
Most methods are questions, and return a relevant value.
</p>

<p>Others modify the object itself, and some have so called side-effects, and
modify something else, e.g. <code>puts</code> and <code>p</code> both output something to the
screen. Other methods might save files, send emails, or store things to
a database.</p>

<p class="hint">
Some methods are commands, and change the object, or the system (e.g. by saving a file).
</p>

  <h1>Passing arguments</h1>

<p><em>Extra information needed</em></p>

<p>Sometimes an object needs a
little bit of extra information in order to do what you ask for.</p>

<p>For example the class <code>String</code> defines the method <code>delete</code> which returns
another String with some of the characters deleted. In order to do so, of
course, it needs to know which characters we&rsquo;d like to remove.</p>

<p>We can pass things by appending parentheses <code>()</code> to the method call (the name).
We can then include the extra bit of information needed (in our case another
string) inside the parentheses like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby Monstas"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">delete</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"by Mo"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Runstas"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Hm. Not sure what &ldquo;Runstas&rdquo; means. Ideas? Let us know.</p>

<p>Anyhow, another example for a method that needs an argument is the method
<code>prepend</code> on Strings. This method returns a new String with the given String
prepended:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby Monstas"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">prepend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Oh, hello, "</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Oh, hello, Ruby Monstas"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>These extra bits of information are called <em>arguments</em>. We&rsquo;ll discuss them more
once we get to define <a href="../writing_methods.html">our own methods</a>.</p>

<p>Not all methods need these extra bits of information (arguments) in order to do
their job.  E.g. the method <code>length</code> on Strings knows the length of their
String just so (because it knows its String). Sometimes they need one or more
arguments though.</p>

<p>So how do you know?</p>

<p>You might remember, over time, for some important methods, but most of us also
check the documentation quite frequently, too. Some times it&rsquo;s just fine to
try it out quickly, and only check the documentation if it does not work as
expected.</p>

  <h1>Listing methods</h1>

<p>As said above, if you are curious what methods are defined on a certain object,
then you can check the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/">Ruby documentation</a>
for this class. (Usually the right page conveniently shows up at the top when
you google for &ldquo;ruby&rdquo; and the class name.)</p>

<p>However, you can also quickly pop into IRB and ask the object for its methods.
That&rsquo;s right, <code>methods</code> is a method defined on all objects (just like <code>class</code>,
and <code>is_a?</code>).</p>

<p>When you call it then it will return (respond with) an Array with all the
method names that the object has.</p>

<p>It makes sense to sort the Array, so it is easier to read. Like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby Monstas"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">methods</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">sort</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[:</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:&lt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:[]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:class</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:downcase</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:delete</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:include?</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:is_a?</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:length</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:prepend</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:start_with?</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Yep, the method names come as Symbols, because they&rsquo;re considered code.</p>

<p>If you do this yourself, you&rsquo;ll see that the String actually has a lot more
methods. Many of these actually aren&rsquo;t used very often, but some are quite
useful. We have stripped the Array down a little, because we want to talk about
some of these methods more.</p>

<h2>Chaining method calls</h2>

<p>Btw the code above also demonstrates that methods can be &ldquo;chained&rdquo;: When we
call a method on an object it will return another object to us. We can then
immediately call another method on that new object, and so on.</p>

<p>In our example above the method <code>methods</code> returns a Array of names. And
Arrays respond to (have) the method <code>sort</code>, so we can call this method
immediately, by using another dot.</p>

<p>We could chain some of the method calls from our String example above like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby Monstas"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">prepend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Oh, hello, "</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">upcase</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"OH, HELLO, RUBY MONSTAS"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So we have a String <code>&quot;Ruby Monstas&quot;</code>, prepend another String to it, which
returns a new String <code>&quot;Oh, hello, Ruby Monstas&quot;</code>, on which we immediately call
the method upcase.</p>

<p>Pretty handy.</p>

<p>As you can see Ruby will first evaluate the bit <code>name.prepend(&quot;Oh, hello, &quot;)</code>.
It needs to do that so it knows the object (the new String) that is going
to be returned from this, so it can then call the method <code>upcase</code> on it.</p>

<p>Does this make sense?</p>

  <h1>Predicate methods</h1>

<p>If you check the list of methods on our String above you see that in Ruby we
can have methods that end with a question mark <code>?</code>. What&rsquo;s up with that?</p>

<p>By convention, in Ruby, these methods return either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. For
example, we can ask a number if it is even or odd:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">odd?</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">even?</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This makes them read like a question, which is pretty cool.</p>

<p>Or you can ask the number if it&rsquo;s between two other numbers. Obviously this
methods needs us to pass those two other numbers. So now we also have an example
of a method that takes two arguments:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">between?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">between?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>These methods are called <em>predicate methods</em> in Ruby. Not quite sure why, maybe
because of the historical math context of programming.</p>

<p class="hint">
Predicate methods that end with a question mark <code>?</code> return either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>Strings also define some predicate methods:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby Monstas"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">start_with?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"R"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">start_with?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Do you also think it&rsquo;s kinda odd that <code>name.start_with?(&quot;a&quot;)</code> reads almost like
English, but not quite? Maybe the method could have been named <code>starts_with?</code>
instead, right? That&rsquo;s true. This is because Matz, the creator of Ruby, is not
a native English speaker, and some names sound right in Japanese when
translated literally.</p>

<p>Also:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby Monstas"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">include?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"by"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">include?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"r"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>When we check what methods there are defined on a number, we find some with the
same name, but also different ones:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">methods</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">sort</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[:</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:between?</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:even?</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:odd?</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:zero?</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try <code>zero?</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">zero?</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">zero?</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Arrays have the methods <code>include?</code>, and Hashes respond to <code>key?</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">include?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">include?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">false</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="p">}.</span><span class="nf">key?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"one"</span> <span class="p">}.</span><span class="nf">key?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Oh by the way, if you&rsquo;re curious why operators like <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> and so on are
also listed here, check the chapter that explains that <a href="../operators/methods.html">operators are methods,
too</a>.</p>

  <h1>Bang Methods</h1>

<p>All of the examples that we&rsquo;ve discussed before have one thing in common:</p>

<p>They are questions, and do not modify the object they are called on.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby Monstas"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">downcase</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">ruby</span> <span class="n">monstas</span>
<span class="no">Ruby</span> <span class="no">Monstas</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the method <code>downcase</code> has returned a new String, which is the
lowercase version of the String that the method is being called on. When we
output the original String on the next line, we can then see that it&rsquo;s still
the same: The method <code>downcase</code> does not modify the String.</p>

<p>However, there also are variants of some of these methods, which end in an
exclamation mark <code>!</code>. These methods are called &ldquo;bang methods&rdquo;, and they usually
modify the object that they&rsquo;re being called on.</p>

<p class="hint">
Bang methods end with an exlamation mark, and often modify the object they are called on.
</p>

<p>For example, next to the method <code>downcase</code> Strings also have a method <code>downcase!</code>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try that:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Ruby Monstas"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">downcase!</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">ruby</span> <span class="n">monstas</span>
<span class="n">ruby</span> <span class="n">monstas</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see calling the method <code>downcase!</code> on the second line has modified
the String itself (the object that <code>name</code> refers to), and <em>also</em> returned the
new downcased version.</p>

<p>Nowadays programmers have learned that using these methods has a number of
disadvantages, and usually should be avoided, unless there are very good
reasons for it (usually, there are none).</p>

<p class="hint">
Use bang methods with caution.
</p>

<p>We mostly mention these methods because you might see them used elsewhere.</p>

  <h1>Writing Methods</h1>

<p><em>A named block of code that takes input and returns output</em></p>

<p>Everything in programming is about data, and doing interesting things with it.
If you think about Twitter, it essentially takes 140 characters of text
(which is data) from their users and displays it to others.</p>

<p>You have already learned about the most important primitive (simple) types of
data in Ruby: numbers, strings, true, false and nil. And we&rsquo;ve had a look at
the two most common data structures, Arrays and Hashes.</p>

<p>All of this is about the <em>data</em> part. Methods on the other hand are about the
<em>doing interesting things</em> part.</p>

<p>In this chapter we&rsquo;ll have a closer look at the anatomy of a method, and you&rsquo;ll
learn how to implement, and use, your own methods.</p>

<h2>Methods define behaviour</h2>

<p>Methods are all about defining <em>behaviour</em>, so that they can be applied to
different bits of data in different contexts easily.</p>

<p>For example, there are methods that do things like: transforming a String,
sorting a list, reading a CSV or Excel file, sending an email, signing in to
Facebook, sending a Tweet.</p>

<p>Another way of putting this is: Methods are a way of assigning a name to a
certain piece of code. Just like a variable allows to &ldquo;look up&rdquo; or refer to
the object that the name was assigned to &hellip; methods allow to execute their
code.</p>

<p class="hint">
Variables name things, methods name behaviour (code).
</p>

<p>Methods make code re-usable, by the way of packaging (&ldquo;encapsulating&rdquo;) code and
sticking a name on it.</p>

<p>As you have seen Ruby comes with lots of methods predefined - written by
experienced programmers. So, unless you&rsquo;re studying computer science and you&rsquo;re
faced with the exercise of implementing your own, complicated sorting
algorithms for data collections, &hellip; you&rsquo;ll just use the method <code>sort</code> that
already comes defined for Arrays in Ruby out of the box.</p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s see what makes up a method, and how we can define our own ones.</p>

  <h1>What makes a method</h1>

<p>There are four things that constitute a method:</p>

<ul>
<li>a name</li>
<li>a block of code</li>
<li>(optionally) accepting input</li>
<li>returning output</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all methods actually need input (so they don&rsquo;t take any), and not always do
we care about the output that a method returns.</p>

<p>Imagine a vending machine where you can chip in some money, press some buttons,
and the machine will spin a few gears and wheels, and spit out the chocolate
bar you were after.</p>

<p>If the vending machine was a method, then your money, as well as the buttons
you press are the <em>input</em>. The way the machine internally spins certain
mechanics is the <em>block of code</em>, the stuff it does internally. And the product
that it dispenses is the <em>return value</em>.</p>

<p>Although this would be an odd thing to mention to a non-programmer, we could
say that a vending machine is a way of &ldquo;transforming&rdquo; money and data into
chocolate.</p>

<p>Methods are a lot like that.</p>

<p class="hint">
Methods have a name, take some input, do something with it, and return a result.
</p>

<p>Programmers usually don&rsquo;t use the term &ldquo;input&rdquo; in this context. Instead we say
that a method accepts a number of <em>arguments</em> (pieces of input). And instead of
&ldquo;output&rdquo; we use the term <em>return value</em>: the thing that we get back from the
method.</p>

<p class="hint">
A method&rsquo;s input is referred to as &ldquo;arguments&rdquo;, while its output is called a
&ldquo;return value&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>This will become more clear in the following chapters. Let&rsquo;s define a method next.</p>

  <h1>Defining a method</h1>

<p>So far you have seen methods that &ldquo;belong&rdquo; to objects, or, in other words,
are defined on objects, and can be called on objects. E.g. you have seen the
method <code>downcase</code> which is defined on every string.</p>

<p>However, Ruby also knows methods that are not defined on any of these objects.
They&rsquo;re sort of &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; methods.</p>

<p>For example, you can try this in <code>irb</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">is_a?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Object</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="kp">true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;ll use this type of methods in this chapter because we want to focus on the
characteristics of methods. If you&rsquo;re curious what&rsquo;s up with them have a look
at the bonus chapter about the <a href="bonus/top_level.html">top-level object</a>. Later
when you learn how to define your own classes we also look at defining methods
for these.</p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<p>Suppose we need to define a simple method that takes a number, adds the number
<code>2</code> to it, and returns the result. Here&rsquo;s how we can do that:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This <em>defines</em> a method. It does not <em>use</em> it, yet: You only build and place
that vending machine, so it can be used (by yourself, or others) later.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through this method definition step by step:</p>

<p>Ruby will start reading the code at the top, and find the keyword <code>def</code>. This
tells Ruby that we&rsquo;re about to define a new method.</p>

<p>Methods need a name, so Ruby looks for it next, and finds the word <code>add_two</code>.</p>

<p>Ruby then checks if we define anything to &ldquo;input&rdquo; to the method (remember, this
is optional). She finds the parentheses, and knows that we&rsquo;re about to define
a list of things that can be given to the method. This list is called an
<em>argument list</em>.</p>

<p class="hint">
An argument list defines names for objects passed to the method, enclosed by
parentheses right after the method name.
</p>

<p>In our case the argument list has one single argument <code>number</code>, which means
our method can accept one single thing (object).</p>

<p>The next line is the block of code that our method has (&ldquo;encapsulates&rdquo;). This
is also referred to as the <em>method body</em>. In our case that&rsquo;s just one single
line because the operation that our method encapsulates is very simple. Other
methods (think of <code>sort</code>, defined on Arrays) would require more code, and are
longer.</p>

<p>Inside the method body the arguments are known as local variables: You can see
how the code in our method body uses the variable name <code>number</code>.</p>

<p>Finally the keyword <code>end</code> tells Ruby that we&rsquo;re done with the method body, and
the method definition.</p>

<p>All we&rsquo;ve done so far is defining the method, we haven&rsquo;t used it for anything,
yet. We&rsquo;ll do that in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="hint formatting">
On formatting: Note that the keywords <code>def</code> and <code>end</code> sit
on the same level, while the method body is indented by two spaces. Also, there
are no space before or inside the argument list, i.e. the <code>()</code>
parentheses.
</p>

  <h1>Using (calling) a method</h1>

<p>Once defined we can use our method.</p>

<p>As programmers we usually say that we &ldquo;call&rdquo; a method. This means we ask Ruby
to execute the code that the method body has, with some given arguments
(input), if any.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how that looks:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s inspect what&rsquo;s happening here under the microscope. If you don&rsquo;t
understand each part of this just yet, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll get back to all of
this.</p>

<p>On the first three lines Ruby defines the method <code>add_two</code> as discussed above.</p>

<ul>
<li>On the next line Ruby will look at the bit <code>add_two(3)</code> first. She recognizes
that we are referring to a method defined earlier, and this will tell her we
want to call (execute, use) this method.</li>
<li>In order to do so she first needs to look at what&rsquo;s inside the parantheses
<code>()</code> so she can pass it on. She finds the <code>3</code> and creates a new object
(number) for it.</li>
<li>Now Ruby is ready to actually call (execute, use) the method, passing the
number <code>3</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So Ruby now deviates from the normal flow, which just goes from top to bottom
in our file. Instead she now jumps into the method body.</p>

<p>In this moment she now <em>assigns</em> the number <code>3</code> to a local variable <code>number</code>
before she starts executing the method body.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. This is how method <em>arguments</em> work:</p>

<p>When a method is called and objects are passed as arguments, then Ruby
implicitely defines local variables with the argument names. She assigns the
passed objects to the variable names that are in the argument list. These local
variables are then available in the method body.</p>

<p>In our case we have just one argument <code>number</code>. So we get one local variable
<code>number</code> with the object <code>3</code> assigned (because that&rsquo;s the object passed when we
called the method).</p>

<p>You can imagine the method body now reads like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so we&rsquo;re inside the method body now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby will now execute (evaluate, run) the method body (again, going from top
to bottom), which in our case is just a single line with the expression
<code>number + 2</code>.</li>
<li>Because <code>number</code> is assigned <code>3</code> this expression will evaluate to <code>5</code>.</li>
<li>Since this line of code is the last line in the method body, the value <code>5</code>
also is the value returned from the method call.</li>
</ul>

<p>So Ruby now jumps back out of the method. The expression <code>add_two(3)</code> has just
returned the object <code>5</code>. Imagine the last line now reads like this instead:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And that will now print the number <code>5</code> to the screen.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have a closer look at that thing with the return value (&ldquo;output&rdquo;), as
we just rushed over that a little.</p>

  <h1>Return values</h1>

<p>In Ruby, a method always return exactly one single thing (an object).</p>

<p>The returned object can be anything, but a method can only return one thing,
and it also <em>always returns something</em>.</p>

<p class="hint">
Every method always returns exactly one object.
</p>

<p>The object returned could be the object <code>nil</code>, meaning &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;, but it still
is an object.  Also, in order to return a bunch of things at once we could
return an Array that holds the things that we are interested in, but the Array
itself is just one object.</p>

<p>Also note that in Ruby we do not have to use the statement <code>return</code>, as in
other languages. In fact, most Ruby code does not use the keyword <code>return</code> at
all.</p>

<p>This is extremely convenient, but it is also something we need to learn:</p>

<p>If we don&rsquo;t do anything else, then a method will return <em>the value that was
returned from the last evaluated statement</em>. Most often, this is the last line
in the method body.</p>

<p>This is important to understand. Please read that sentence again:</p>

<p><p class="hint">
If we don&rsquo;t do anything else, then a method will return the return value of
the last evaluated statement.
<p></p>

<p>In our example method &hellip;</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; the last evaluated statement is the expression <code>number + 2</code>. Since in our
example <code>number</code> is assigned <code>3</code> this expression returns the number <code>5</code>, and
that is why the value returned by our method also is <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>If, in certain cases, we do want to &ldquo;return&rdquo; from the method early, then we can
still do this using the <code>return</code> statement. For now, you don&rsquo;t need to worry
about this case.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s move on :)</p>

  <h1>Scopes</h1>

<p><em>Spheres of visibility, like rooms in a house</em></p>

<p>When we talked about variables we mentioned that the most common type of
variables is the &ldquo;local variable&rdquo;, without explaining any further why they are
local. Local to what? Where? We&rsquo;re finally ready to explain that more.</p>

<p>Since we have now talked about methods, we can also discuss another important
concept: scopes.</p>

<p>Wikipedia says: <em>&ldquo;In programming, the scope of a name is the part of a program
where the name is valid: where the name can be used to refer to something
else.&rdquo;</em> (slightly modified to match our own terminology)</p>

<p class="hint">
Names are known (or defined) in a certain scope, and unknown (or undefined)
outside of this scope.
</p>

<p>You can think about a scope as of a sphere, a bubble, or a room (with no
windows, and doors closed): Certain names, like variable names, are &ldquo;known&rdquo; and
&ldquo;visible&rdquo; inside of the room. Other names, known and visible in another room are
not known in this room, but only in the other room.</p>

<p>Every time there is a method call, and the flow of execution enters the
method&rsquo;s body, it enters a new scope, or &ldquo;room&rdquo;. Things that are &ldquo;local&rdquo; to
this method&rsquo;s scope (i.e. things that are &ldquo;inside&rdquo; of the room), are <em>only</em>
visible in this scope. Outside of it, they are unknown.</p>

<h2>Undefined local variable or method</h2>

<p>This is also a good opportunity to talk about an error message that you
might see most often. E.g. you&rsquo;ll see it every time when you made a typo
and misspelled a variable or method name.</p>

<p>Consider this code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">number</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The line <code>puts add_two(2)</code> will output <code>5</code>, but the line <code>puts number</code> will
then raise an error.</p>

<p>This is because the variable <code>number</code> that is assigned the number <code>3</code> when we
call the method is a <em>local</em> variable. It is local to the method&rsquo;s scope. It
is created when the flow of execution enters the method.</p>

<p>Outside of this scope, when the flow of execution has returned from the method
the method&rsquo;s scope has been destroyed, and all local variables are gone. The
local variable <code>number</code> is therefore not known, and Ruby raises an error saying
<code>undefined local variable or method &#39;number&#39;</code>.</p>

<p>If you think about this error message for little bit, does it make sense to
you?</p>

<p>We have silently skipped over the fact that, in Ruby, both local variable
names and method names, are written the same way: they&rsquo;re just plain words.
For example, here:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">number</span>
</code></pre>

<p><code>number</code> is a local variable, and it is used in the line <code>puts number</code>.</p>

<p>However, here:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">number</span>
  <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">number</span>
</code></pre>

<p><code>number</code> is the name of a method. And it can be used (called) in the exact same
way: <code>puts number</code></p>

<p>This is because Ruby, when it executes a program, evaluates one statement after
another. And when it encounters a plain word like <code>number</code> then it will first
check if, within the current scope, it knows a local variable with the same
name. If so, it will use the value that is associated to this variable. If
there&rsquo;s no local variable with this name, then it will look for a method. If
there&rsquo;s also no method with this name it will then raise the error message
<code>undefined local variable or method &#39;number&#39;</code>.</p>

<p>So the error message is pretty precise, but also sounds kind of convoluted. What
it basically tries to say is:</p>

<p><em>You&rsquo;ve used the word &ldquo;number&rdquo; here, and i don&rsquo;t know it (in this scope). Did
you mean to use a local variable? Or a method?</em></p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Back to the topic of local scopes. Let&rsquo;s look at another example:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">add_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>What do you think the output will be? Will it be <code>3</code>, or <code>5</code>? Something else?</p>

<p>If you run the code you will see that it&rsquo;s <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>The reason for that is that we do assign the number <code>1</code> in the outer scope to a
variable <code>number</code>, but this variable is then never used: the only other line in
the outer scope is the last line <code>puts add_to(3)</code>, and this line does not use
the variable <code>number</code>.</p>

<p>Instead, when the control flow enters the method <code>add_to</code> Ruby will create a
new local scope, and it will define a new local variable <code>number</code> which is
assigned the number <code>3</code> that was passed to the method. This new variable
<code>number</code> is <em>local</em> to the method&rsquo;s scope, and therefore this is a <em>different</em>
variable than the one on the very first line, in the outer scope.</p>

<p>We found the following a good metaphor for scopes:</p>

<p>When Ruby enters a method, it&rsquo;s like she enters a shiny new room in a
house. With her, she brings the objects that are passed as arguments to the
method call. In the example above she brings an object that is the number <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as Ruby enters the method, she sticks post-it notes on the
objects, according to the argument list from the method definition. In our
example that is the name <code>number</code>. So from now on, in this room, there&rsquo;s a
known local variable that has a value assigned: The object (number) <code>3</code> with
the post-it note <code>number</code> on it.</p>

<p>In our example, the outer scope and the scope of the method <code>add_two</code>, are
two different rooms, and there are two different post-it notes stuck on
two different numbers, which just happen to have the same name on them.</p>

  <h1>Combining Methods</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;ve discussed how to define a method, and how to call (use) it.</p>

<p>What if one method is not enough? What if methods need to do more complicated
things?</p>

<p>Easy. We can call methods from other methods.</p>

<p>For example, we could re-write (&ldquo;re-implement&rdquo;) our method <code>add_two</code> using
another method <code>add_one</code>, and simply call it twice:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This would output <code>5</code> just like our previous examples. Do you understand how it
works?</p>

<p>Of course, in Ruby we could also just solve this whole thing with simply using
the <code>+</code> operator.</p>

<p>However, for the sake of the example, let&rsquo;s have a look how we could add a method
that does the exact same thing as the <code>+</code> operator, too:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">other</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>We can now use that method like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Which, again, would output <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>Note that in this example our method <code>sum</code> now takes two arguments, and so,
when we call (use) it, we also need to pass two numbers (i.e. add them inside
the parentheses on the last line).</p>

<p>Now, with this method in place we could change (&ldquo;refactor&rdquo;) our previous methods
to use it:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">other</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">add_one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Again, these examples are not super realistic, as we&rsquo;d probably just use the
<code>+</code> operator in the first place, in practice.</p>

<p>However, we think this nicely demostrates how you can use one method from
another &hellip; and how different methods require different numbers of arguments.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll look at a more realistic example in the next chapter.</p>

  <h1>Printing things</h1>

<p>Many of the exercises that you do while doing your first steps with Ruby
basics include running a short Ruby program that outputs something to the
terminal.</p>

<p>So far, we have mostly used the method <code>puts</code> to do that.</p>

<p>However, there&rsquo;s another method that is even more useful when we are trying
to figure out what a program is doing, why it is doing it, and what a certain
error might be about.</p>

<p>This method is the method <code>p</code>. In order to understand <code>p</code> better, we want to
look at another method first, which is the method <code>inspect</code>.</p>

<p>The method <code>inspect</code> is available on any object in Ruby. It returns a string
that is a representation of the object itself: a representation that is as
close as possible to the code that you use to create the object. So <code>inspect</code>
is useful to inspect objects, duh :)</p>

<p>This becomes more clear when you try it in IRB:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">inspect</span>
<span class="mi">5</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"A string"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">inspect</span>
<span class="s2">"A string"</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">inspect</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the string returned from <code>inspect</code> is exactly the same as the
Ruby code that we used to create the object. That is really convenient.</p>

<p>However, typing <code>puts something.inspect</code> is quite a bit of work to do. That&rsquo;s
12 characters to type next to the object itself!</p>

<p>Therefore Ruby has a method to make our lifes easier, and does this work for us.
That&rsquo;s the method <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>This method is implemented like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">p</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">inspect</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you are trying to figure out what a certain line of code does, what&rsquo;s
assigned to a variable, or what a method call returns, we recommend to use <code>p</code>
because it tells you exactly what the thing that you are looking at is.</p>

<p><code>puts</code> on the other hand tries to be smart.</p>

<p>For example when you pass an array to <code>puts</code> then it will output each of the
objects on a separate line:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">something</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">something</span>
<span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="mi">3</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the output for numbers and strings that contain numbers is exactly the
same when you use <code>puts</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="mi">123</span>
<span class="mi">123</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"123"</span>
<span class="mi">123</span>
</code></pre>

<p>From the output of <code>puts</code> it often is not clear whether the object that you are
looking it is an array that contains numbers, or an array that contains
strings, or just a long string that contains linebreaks.</p>

<p>In short, <code>puts</code> is useful when you are writing a program that is supposed to
actually output something to the screen. Like, this could be a command line
tool that you write in order to make your own life easier at your job, and that
is helpful at automating some repetitive work. Or it is useful in Ruby
programming exercises :)</p>

<p>On the other hand <code>p</code> is useful when you are trying to understand what your
code does, e.g. when you are trying to figure out a certain error.</p>

  <h1>Writing classes</h1>

<p><em>Finally, our first own class</em></p>

<p>Since in Ruby &ldquo;everything is an object&rdquo;, we have worked with objects quite a
bit already.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve created numbers, Strings, and seen objects like <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and
<code>nil</code>. We have also looked at their class names by calling, e.g. <code>&quot;a
string&quot;.class</code>, and we have explored some other methods that these objects
have. We have also talked about how you can define your own methods, and how
you can call them, passing arguments as required.</p>

<p>That means we now have all the tools that we need to finally learn how to
define and use your own classes. And this is where things suddenly become even
more fun!</p>

<p>You can think of objects as having two things: They know <em>stuff</em>, and they can
<em>do something</em> with stuff (their own stuff, as well as the stuff that gets
passed to them).</p>

<p>Imagine you were an object that is an instance of the class <code>Person</code>. Well, in
a certain way, you actually are :)</p>

<p>Since you are a <code>Person</code>, you are able to remember your own name. And you are
able to do something with it: When asked, you can tell your name to others,
that is, you can return it to the &ldquo;caller&rdquo;, to whoever asked.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll define this exact class in just a few chapters. However, before we do
that, we&rsquo;ll first look at how to define the method <code>add_two</code> to a class
<code>Calculator</code> &hellip; just because we can, and because you&rsquo;re already familiar with
these methods.</p>

  <h1>Defining classes</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by creating a class <code>Calculator</code>, and adding some methods to it,
step by step.</p>

<p>In Ruby, you define a class like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Calculator</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s not a very useful class, since it&rsquo;s completely empty, but
it&rsquo;s a class.</p>

<p class="hint">
A class is defined using the keyword <code>class</code>, a name, and the
keyword <code>end</code>.
</p>

<p>Also, you see that the class has the name <code>Calculator</code>, which starts with an
uppercase letter. In Ruby, this is required, and you&rsquo;d get an error if you
tried to define a class <code>calculator</code>.</p>

<p>Also, for class names that consist of several words the Ruby community has the
convention to separate these words by uppercase letters, as in
<code>RubyStudyGroup</code>.  This is called CamelCase, because of the humps. Whereas for
variable and method names we use underscores, and keep everything lowercase:
<code>local_variable</code> and <code>method_name</code>. This is called snake_case.</p>

<p class="hint">
Class names must start with an uppercase letter, and should use CamelCase.
Variable and methods names should use snake_case.
</p>

<p>Ok, back to our class <code>Calculator</code>.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;ve defined a full, valid class, we can now already use it to create a
new, concrete calculator instance, an object from it.</p>

<p>You can think about the instance as the concrete calculator object that you can
hold in your hands, and use to do actual calculations. The class on the other
hand is more like the idea or concept of a calculator, like the idea of it that
you have when you order a calculator online.</p>

<p>Ok, here&rsquo;s how to do create a new, concrete instance from our class:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">Calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. <code>new</code> is a method, and it is defined on the class itself (which,
as you might remember, is also an object, so it can have methods). This method
creates a new instance of the class, and returns it.</p>

<p class="hint">
The method <code>new</code> is defined on every class, and returns a new
instance of the class.
</p>

<p>Cool. Let&rsquo;s have a look at that object:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="no">Calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The output will seem a little bit weird, and technical at first:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>#&lt;Calculator:0x007fb2fbe50910&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The format <code>#&lt;...&gt;</code> tells you that this object is not a simple thing like a
number, string, or array. Instead, it just tells you the name of the class,
<code>Calculator</code>, and the internal id that Ruby has assigned to this object.</p>

<p>Every object has its own, unique, internal object id, and when I ran this code
on my computer, Ruby assigned the id <code>0x007fb2fbe50910</code>. If you run it,
you&rsquo;ll get a different one. In practice, most of the time, you can simply ignore
this id.</p>

<p>Also, we can check that our new calculator instance indeed is an instance of
the class <code>Calculator</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Calculator</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">calculator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">class</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">Calculator</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">is_a?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Calculator</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</code></pre>

  <h1>Defining instance methods</h1>

<p>If you have read closely methods can be defined and called on objects (i.e.
instances), e.g. <code>1.odd?</code>. And you have just seen that they can also be
defined on classes, e.g. <code>Calculator.new</code>.</p>

<p>Fairly straightforward, methods that are available on classes are called
<em>class methods</em>, and methods that are available on instances are called
<em>instance methods</em>.</p>

<p>In this chapter we want to add the &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; methods that we&rsquo;ve learned to
port (move) in the previous chapters <a href="../writing_methods.html">Writing Methods</a>
to our class <code>Calculator</code> so that they&rsquo;ll end up as instance methods.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how we can do that.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Calculator</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">other</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. You simply move the method into the class body, so that it&rsquo;s
enclosed by it.</p>

<p class="hint">
Instance methods are defined inside the class body.
</p>

<p>Also note that the method definition is indented by one level, that is, 2
spaces. This signals that the method <code>sum</code> belongs to the class <code>Calculator</code>.
Everything between the line <code>class Calculator</code> and the final line <code>end</code> is
called the &ldquo;class body&rdquo;, and just like method bodies we indent them by one more
level.</p>

<p class="hint formatting">
On formatting: the keywords <code>class</code> and <code>end</code> sit on
the same level. The class body is indented by one level.
</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>So, how can we use the new method? That is, how can we <em>call</em> the method <code>sum</code>
on a calculator?</p>

<p>Before you read more, think about this a little. In theory you have all the bits
and pieces to answer this question:</p>

<ul>
<li>You know how to create a new calculator instance (object).</li>
<li>You know how to call a method on an object.</li>
<li>You know how to pass arguments (extra bits of information) to the method call.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can instantiate (&ldquo;order&rdquo;) a new instance from our <code>Calculator</code> class, and
call the method <code>sum</code> on it like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">calculator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will output <code>5</code>. Success :)</p>

<p>A calculator that cannot do anything but additions is pretty useless. Let&rsquo;s
spice our class up by adding more operations, i.e. methods. Also, let&rsquo;s rename
<code>sum</code> to <code>plus</code> so it matches the operator:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Calculator</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">plus</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">other</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">minus</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">other</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multiply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">other</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">divide</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">other</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now our calculator already is slightly more useful: We can do the most basic
math operations with it.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">calculator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">plus</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">minus</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">multiply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">divide</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will output:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>5
-1
6
0
</code></pre>

<p>Whoops!</p>

<p>This looks all good except for the last line, right. Remember why that is?
Right, dividing one integer number by another returns, again, an integer
number. And these aren&rsquo;t quite great for calculating divisions.</p>

<p>One thing we could do about this is require the users of our calculator to pass
(provide) the appropriate types of numbers themselves. So it would be their own
responsibility if something goes wrong with the division.</p>

<p>However, we could also think that a calculator should be smart enough to notice
this.  So we could improve our calculator to always change the type of the
numbers passed to floating point numbers as part of the method <code>divide</code>. In
other words, the method <code>divide</code> would take the numbers, makes sure at least
one of them is a <code>Float</code> (floating point number), and only then do the
calculation.</p>

<p>The method used to convert an integer to a float is <code>to_f</code>. When called on a
float it will just return the float:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_f</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_f</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Alright, lets use that knowledge to improve our <code>divide</code> method. It will be
sufficient to call the method <code>to_f</code> on one of the numbers, because that will
make sure we get a <code>Float</code> back:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Calculator</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">divide</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_f</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">other</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>With that in place our calculator always returns a <code>Float</code> from the method
<code>divide</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">calculator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">plus</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">minus</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">multiply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">divide</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will output:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>5
-1
6
0.666666666666
</code></pre>

<p>Perfect.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move on, and define a class <code>Person</code>, which should be even more fun.</p>

  <h1>Initializing objects</h1>

<p><em>In the moment of birth</em></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start over, and define a new class.</p>

<p>Remember how we said that objects can be thought of as two things: They know
<em>stuff</em>, and they can <em>do things</em>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s define a class <code>Person</code>. People obviously also know things, and can do things.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to define a shiny, new, empty class <code>Person</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Again, that&rsquo;s not a very useful class, but we can instantiate it, and create an
actual, concrete person instance (object) from it:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now, before we add any behaviour (methods) to our class, we want to be able to
give it some initial data: In our case, we want the person to know its own
name.</p>

<p>We can do this like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You see that we add a method called <code>initialize</code> to the class, and this method
accepts a single argument, which is called <code>name</code>. At the moment, this method
is still empty. We&rsquo;ll add some code to it in a bit.</p>

<p>The important bit to learn for you is: the method <code>initialize</code> is a special
method with a special meaning in Ruby:</p>

<p>Whenever you call the method <code>new</code> on a class, as in <code>Person.new</code>, the class
will create a new instance of itself. It will then, internally, call the method
<code>initialize</code> on the new object. Doing so it will simply <em>pass all the
arguments</em> that you passed to <code>new</code> <em>on to</em> the method <code>initialize</code>.</p>

<p>So we can now create a new person instance by calling &hellip;</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ada"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; and the string <code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code> will be passed on to our <code>initialize</code> method, and
end up being assigned to the local variable <code>name</code>.</p>

<p class="hint">
The special method <code>initialize</code> is called under the hood when the
object has been created by the class method <code>new</code>.
</p>

<p>Obviously, our <code>initialize</code> method does not <em>do</em> anything with the String
passed, yet. That&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;ll get to that in the next chapter.</p>

<p>To recap, when you call <code>new</code> on the class <code>Person</code>, and pass the string
<code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code> then the method <code>new</code> will create a new instance of the class, and call
<code>initialize</code> on it, passing the same argument list, which in our case is the
single string <code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>When we create a new instance of a class by the way of calling the method <code>new</code>
on that class, we also say that we &ldquo;instantiate&rdquo; that object: By calling
<code>Person.new</code> we instantiate a new person object.</p>

  <h1>Instance variables</h1>

<p><em>An object&rsquo;s own knowledge</em></p>

<p>Now that you understand how the string that we pass to the method <code>new</code>
ends up being passed to the new object&rsquo;s <code>initialize</code> method, we can start
improving <code>initialize</code>, so it does something with the string, and actually
<em>initializes</em> our new object:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This introduces another new concept: <code>@name</code> is a new type of variable, called
an &ldquo;instance variable&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The body of the <code>initialize</code> method now does nothing else but assign the value
of the local variable <code>name</code> to an instance variable <code>@name</code>.</p>

<p>You remember how we said that each method has its own local scope, which is
created when the method is called, and populated with local variables from the
arguments list. You have also learned that this scope is erased, and thrown
away when Ruby exits the method body and returns from the method. And that
local variables that are visible in one method are not visible in other
methods: that&rsquo;s why they are called local.</p>

<p>Now, the thing is: Every <em>object</em> also has its own scope.</p>

<p>An object&rsquo;s scope is populated with instance variables, in the moment we assign
something to them. And they are visible <em>everywhere</em> in the object, that is, in
every method that the object has.</p>

<p class="hint">
Instance variables live in, and are visible everywhere in the object&rsquo;s scope.
</p>

<p>You can think of the object&rsquo;s scope as your own knowledge, or memories.</p>

<p>For example, you know your name, your email address, and your email password.
You keep this knowledge around, and you can use it when you do things (such as
responding to another person). Likewise, an object keeps its instance variables
around, as long as the object exists.</p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s see how that works in practise.</p>

<p>If you create, and output an instance of our class <code>Person</code>, you&rsquo;ll see that
Ruby now prints out the instance variable, too:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ada"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">person</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The first line creates a new instance of the class <code>Person</code>, passing the string
<code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code>, and assign this new object to the variable <code>person</code>. The second line
will then print it out:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>#&lt;Person:0x007fd8947aa868 @name="Ada"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see this includes the instance variable <code>@name</code> with the value
<code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code>: This specific, concrete instance of the class <code>Person</code> knows their
name.</p>

<p>You can think of this as you, as a programmer, creating this new person, and
in the moment of its creation, its birth, you also give it a name. Which kind
of how it works with real people, too, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Hmm, well &hellip; Yeah, sort of. Anyhow, let&rsquo;s move on.</p>

  <h1>Attribute readers</h1>

<p><em>Asking for information</em></p>

<p>Remember how we initially said that people have the ability to remember their
name, and tell it, when asked?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve already implemented the first part of this. Our person instance now
knows her name &ldquo;Ada&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the second part. You also remember that methods are either
questions or commands. We want to add a method that implements answering
the question &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And it is as simple as this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Before we discuss what this does, let&rsquo;s look at how we can use our new method.
We can now call the method on the person object, like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ada"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So this prints the name <code>Ada</code>, and that&rsquo;s what we want: we can create a new
person object, passing a name to it. Once that person has been created we are
able to ask for its name, and we&rsquo;ll get the name back.</p>

<p>How does this work, exactly, under the microscope?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through it, step by step:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On the first line, the object that ends up being assigned to the variable
<code>person</code> is an initialized, new instance of the class <code>Person</code>. By
&ldquo;intialized&rdquo; we mean that the method <code>initialize</code> has already been called,
and it already has assigned the string <code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code> to the instance variable
<code>@name</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now this person object has the method <code>name</code>, as defined in the class
definition of <code>Person</code> above, and in the second line we call this method:
<code>person.name</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When the method <code>name</code> is called, it does nothing else but evaluate the
instance variable <code>@name</code> from the object scope. Because this has previously
been set to <code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code> it will return this string. And because this is the last
line in the method <code>name</code> the method also will return this string.</p></li>
<li><p>For that reason the method call <code>person.name</code> returns the string <code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code>,
which is then passed to <code>puts</code>, which prints it out.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Methods that do nothing else but return a value assigned to an instance
variable with the same name are very common.</p>

<p>In fact they are so common that there&rsquo;s a word for them: they are called
&ldquo;attribute readers&rdquo;. By &ldquo;attribute&rdquo; the Ruby community means an instance
variable, so an attribute reader is a method that reads an instance variable.</p>

<p class="hint">
An attribute reader returns the value of an instance variable.
</p>

<p>Another way of looking at this is that an attribute reader is a method that
&ldquo;exposes&rdquo; an instance variable. It makes it accessible for others. I.e. it
allows you to ask for the value of an instance variable with the same name, and
does nothing but return its value. Once defined others can ask this object for
knowledge that otherwise would be private, and unaccessible.</p>

<p>In our case the attribute reader <code>name</code> exposes the instance variable <code>@name</code>,
so others can ask for it.</p>

<p class="hint">
An attribute reader exposes an instance variable.
</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know why the community has chosen to use the term &ldquo;attribute&rdquo; here:
It would be much less confusing to use the term &ldquo;instance variable reader&rdquo;
instead. Maybe the simple reason is that programmers don&rsquo;t like to type more
than necessary, and this saves 8 characters. Who knows :)</p>

  <h1>Attribute writers</h1>

<p><em>Setting information</em></p>

<p>Imagine in our application a person not only needs a name, but also a password.
However, let&rsquo;s also imagine that, at the time of the creation of a new person
instance, this password is not yet known. (Who would give a toddler an email
password anyway?)</p>

<p>Instead we want to be able to tell the person object about its email password
later.</p>

<p>We can do this like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">password</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the method <code>password=</code> does nothing else but take a single
argument (called <code>password</code>) and assign the value of this local variable to the
instance variable <code>@password</code>.</p>

<p>This method&rsquo;s structure looks exactly the same as the method <code>initialize</code>,
doesn&rsquo;t it? Execpt that <code>initialize</code> is called whenever you call <code>new</code> on the
class. Our new method <code>password=</code> needs to be called on the object itself,
once it has been created.</p>

<p>Again, because this kind of method is used so often, there&rsquo;s another name for
it: it&rsquo;s an attribute writer. (And again, we think it should have been called
an &ldquo;instance variable writer&rdquo; instead.)</p>

<p>Now, we can use the attribute writer like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ada"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"super secret"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">person</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If you execute this, then it will print out:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>#&lt;Person:0x007fb61c1edcf8 @name="Ada", @password="super secret"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, yeah, we can see that, after calling <code>person.password=(&quot;super secret&quot;)</code>
the object now has an instance variable defined, i.e., the person now knows
their password, too.</p>

<p class="hint">
An attribute writer allows setting an instance variable.
</p>

<p>That method call looks a little odd though, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Remember what we&rsquo;ve said above about the syntax sugar that Ruby adds for the
assignment operator <code>=</code>?</p>

<p>Exactly the same works for attribute writers, that is, methods that end with an
equals sign <code>=</code>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. So we can also write this instead:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ada"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"super secret"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And this reads just so much better, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Just remember that, under the hood, when running your code, Ruby translates the
line <code>person.password = &quot;something&quot;</code> to <code>person.password=(&quot;something&quot;)</code>, and
this simply calls the method <code>password=</code>, passing the value on the right hand
side as an argument: it&rsquo;s just another method :)</p>

<p>We think this is pretty cool.</p>

  <h1>State and behaviour</h1>

<p><em>Data and methods</em></p>

<p>Lets have another look our class definition for <code>Person</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">password</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Do you notice something?</p>

<p>Our class demonstrates an important thing about objects:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a way to ask a person for their <code>name</code>, but no way to set a new name.
On the other hand there&rsquo;s a way to set a new password to the person, but no way
to ask for it.</p>

<p>If you think about it, that makes sense, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>If you join our Ruby beginners study group for the first time, and we ask you for
your name, you&rsquo;ll happily tell it. But if we ask for your Gmail password, you
will probably just laugh at us, or stare at us, or show some other error
message. ;) In any case, you won&rsquo;t tell us your email password, because that&rsquo;s
private information.</p>

<p>The same is also true for objects.</p>

<p>Every object has its own object scope that might hold a bunch of instance
variables. These are private to the object. Our person object knows their
password, once it has been given to them. But from then on, they won&rsquo;t tell
anyone the password, because there&rsquo;s no method for that. On the other hand,
there&rsquo;s a method <code>name</code>, which is an attribute reader, so we can ask our person
object for their name. But there&rsquo;s no way for others to give a new name to the
person, because there&rsquo;s no method for that, no attribute writer <code>name=</code>.</p>

<p>This concept is called <em>encapsulation</em>, and it is one of the main motivations
behind the whole paradigm of object-oriented programing:</p>

<p>We can say that an object encapsulates state (data, knowledge), which is
private to the object, and exposes behaviour by the way of having publicly
accessible methods.</p>

<p class="hint">
Objects have state (instance variables) and behaviour (methods).
</p>

<p>So, we have now created our first little class, and it&rsquo;s one that you could
actually see in real applications.</p>

  <h1>Interacting Objects</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;re now able to create our own objects. However, they don&rsquo;t do a whole lot,
yet, right? Why not create two people, and let them greet each other.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d like to achieve:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Anja"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">friend</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Carla"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">friend</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;d like this to print out the following for starters:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">Hi</span> <span class="no">Carla</span><span class="o">!</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If we run the code above we&rsquo;ll get an error message that tells us what to do next:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>NoMethodError: undefined method `greet' for #&lt;Person:0x007fbb5e9c88c8 @name="Anja"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Right, we need to define a method <code>greet</code>. Let&rsquo;s do that:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="c1"># methods from above ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If we run this code, we&rsquo;ll now get a new error message. Great, that&rsquo;s progress:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Right, how would one person greet another without knowing who that other person is?
So we need to make our method accept an argument:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="c1"># methods from above ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If we run this we won&rsquo;t see an error message any more. Yay! However, it also
does not print anything so far - our method does not do anything, yet.</p>

<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s add some actual behaviour, and print out &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; for starters.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="c1"># methods from above ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi!"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>What happens when you run that? It works, right. This should output <code>Hi!</code> to the screen.</p>

<p>However, how can Anja greet Carla, specifically? How can any person greet any
other person? Well, the method knows the person to greet (she has been passed
as an argument to the method) so she can ask her for her name:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="c1"># methods from above ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"!"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Does this make sense?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have another look at the full code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"!"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Anja"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">friend</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Carla"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">friend</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So we instantiate two <code>Person</code> objects, and assign them two variables <code>person</code>
and <code>friend</code>. Then we call the method <code>greet</code> on the first one (Anja), and
pass the second one (<code>friend</code>, which is Carla) as an argument.</p>

<p>Now Ruby jumps into the method body of the method <code>greet</code>, and assigns the
local variable name <code>other</code> to the <code>Person</code> instance passed (i.e. Carla).</p>

<p>It then asks the <code>Person</code> instance <code>other</code> for their name (which will return
the String <code>&quot;Carla&quot;</code>, and concatenates it to (glues it together with) two other
strings <code>&quot;Hi &quot;</code> and <code>&quot;!&quot;</code>. So this results in a new String <code>Hi Carla!</code> which it
then passes to <code>puts</code>.</p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s spice that up a little, and let Anja add her own name to this String,
too:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="c1"># methods from above ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"! My name is "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"."</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Nice. This now outputs:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Hi Carla! My name is Anja.
</code></pre>

<p>Remember how you could call the method <code>add_one</code> from another method <code>add_two</code>
<a href="../writing_methods/combining.html">before</a>? The same works here, too: We can
call the person&rsquo;s own method <code>name</code> by just using it, since this method is
defined on the same class, and thus every instance of <code>Person</code>. We&rsquo;ll look
at this a little more in the <a href="self.html">next chapter</a>.</p>

<p>For now let&rsquo;s add another line at the end, and let Carla greet Anja back.</p>

<p>Again, here&rsquo;s the full code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"! My name is "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"."</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Anja"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">friend</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Carla"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">friend</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">friend</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">person</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And this outputs:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Hi Carla! My name is Anja.
Hi Anja! My name is Carla.
</code></pre>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Of course this is still quite a simplistic example. It already shows how you
can &ldquo;model&rdquo; a certain &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; concept in terms of Ruby code, instantiate
it, and let it interact with another thing.</p>

<p>By the way if you&rsquo;d like to see how to make the method <code>greet</code> more pretty,
and a little bit easier to read, check out the chapter on
<a href="../bonus/string_interpolation.html">String interpolation</a>.</p>

  <h1>Object Scope and Self</h1>

<p>Remember how we said that when Ruby finds a method call she then deviates from
the normal control flow which goes from top to bottom? Instead she jumps into
the method body.</p>

<p>We also said that this method body has its own <a href="writing_methods/scopes.html">scope</a>,
like a shiny, new room where local variables from other scopes are not visible.
Instead it has its own local variables, some of which might be defined via the
method&rsquo;s arguments.</p>

<p>And we also said that inside any object&rsquo;s method all instance variables of
this object, and all other methods of this object are also visible.</p>

<p>We also may have a look at that mysterious <a href="bonus/top_level.html">top-level object</a>
that Ruby enters when she starts executing a program, or IRB.</p>

<p>We are now finally ready to put all these things together a little more, and
introduce a new keyword: <code>self</code>.</p>

<h2>The Object Scope</h2>

<p>In fact, in Ruby, there are even more scopes than just the local method&rsquo;s
scope:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the method&rsquo;s local scope, which holds all local variables. And there&rsquo;s
the object&rsquo;s scope which holds all instance variables and method names.</p>

<p>When Ruby&rsquo;s control flow jumps into a method then both of these scopes are
visible at the same time. For any given name Ruby will first check the local
scope, and then the object scope.</p>

<p>In reality this most importantly means that from any method on an object, you
can access:</p>

<ul>
<li>all local variables</li>
<li>all instance variables</li>
<li>all of the object&rsquo;s methods</li>
</ul>

<p>It also means that one can overwrite, sometimes accidentally, method names
with variable names. Remember they read just the same in Ruby? While this
is a really cool feature, it also means we need to be aware of it.</p>

<p>Consider this code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"! My name is "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"."</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see this defines a new local variable <code>name</code>. The code is very
similar to what we had <a href="writing_classes/interaction.html">before</a>, except
that we store the <code>other</code> person&rsquo;s name to a local variable <code>name</code> first,
and then use this variable on the next line when we put together our String.</p>

<p>This breaks our code, of course, in the sense that we don&rsquo;t get the expected
greeting any more. Instead it contains the same name twice:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Hi Carla! My name is Carla.
</code></pre>

<p>That is because, on the last line of the method <code>greet</code>, when Ruby looks at the
word (identifier) <code>name</code> she first checks the local scope of the method, and
finds a local variable defined, so she uses it. Only if there was no local
variable defined she would check the object&rsquo;s scope, and find the method with
the same name <code>name</code>, and call it.</p>

<p class="hint">
When she finds an identifier, Ruby looks for a local variable first, and then for a method.
</p>

<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s a way to still access the object&rsquo;s scope:</p>

<h2>Self</h2>

<p>Every object knows itself, in every method, by the way of calling <code>self</code>.
This is a special keyword in Ruby, that means just that: The object itself.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try that, and output <code>self</code>. In order to do that we need to add it
somewhere inside the object. Any method would be good for that, but let&rsquo;s
just use the <code>initialize</code> method:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
    <span class="nb">p</span> <span class="nb">self</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Anja"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">person</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This should output something like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1">#&lt;Person:0x007f9994972428 @name="Anja"&gt;</span>
<span class="c1">#&lt;Person:0x007f9994972428 @name="Anja"&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see we output the same object twice. Once in the <code>initialize</code> method
using <code>p self</code>, and once in the outer scope using <code>p person</code>. You can also see
that the cryptic looking object id is the same for both instances. So we can
know it&rsquo;s indeed the very same object.</p>

<p class="hint">
Inside any method the object can be referred to using the keyword <code>self</code>.
</p>

<p>So we can fix our code from above like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">other</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"! My name is "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"."</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now we call the method <code>name</code> on two different objects again. When Ruby sees
<code>self</code> she knows that we&rsquo;re referring to the person object, and she calls the
method <code>name</code> on it.</p>

<p>This fixes our greeting:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Hi Carla! My name is Anja.
</code></pre>

<h2>Keywords</h2>

<p>Why do we keep saying that <code>self</code> is a keyword? Well, because is not a method.
It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;special thing&rdquo; in Ruby. For example this means that the following will
raise an error:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Anja"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">self</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This raises the error:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>NoMethodError: undefined method `self' for #&lt;Person:0x007f9994972428 @name="Anja"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a method, it&rsquo;s a special thing.</p>

<p>Other keywords that also aren&rsquo;t methods (or objects, or classes) are, for
example, <code>def</code>, <code>class</code>, and <code>end</code>. You&rsquo;ll also learn about <code>do</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>elsif</code>
and <code>else</code> a little later.</p>

<p class="hint">
Keywords are words that have a special meaning in Ruby, such as
<code>class</code>, <code>def</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>self</code>.
</p>

  <h1>Blocks</h1>

<p><em>Like methods, but without a name</em></p>

<p>Blocks are one of the things programmers absolutely love about Ruby. They are
an extremely powerful feature that allows us to write very flexible code. At
the same time they read very well, and they are used all over the place.</p>

<p>So, what is a block?</p>

<p>A block, essentially, is the same thing as a method, except it does not have a
name, and does not belong to an object.</p>

<p>I.e. a block is an anonymous piece of code, it can accept input in form of
arguments (if it needs any), and it will return a value, but it does not have a
name.</p>

<p>Moreover, blocks can only be created by the way of passing them to a method
when the method is called.</p>

<p class="hint">
A block is a piece of code that accepts arguments, and returns a value. A block
is always passed to a method call.
</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s jump right in:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">times</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Oh, hello from inside a block!"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see <code>times</code> is a method that is defined on numbers: <code>5.times</code> calls
the method <code>times</code> on the number <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>Now, when this method is called the only thing passed is a block: that is the
anonymous piece of code between <code>do</code> and <code>end</code>. There are no objects passed as
arguments to the method <code>times</code>, instead it just passes a block.</p>

<p>The method <code>times</code> is implemented in such a way that it simply calls (executes)
the block 5 times, and thus, when you run the code, it will print out the
message <code>&quot;Oh, hello from inside a block!&quot;</code> 5 times.</p>

<p>The code almost reads like an English sentence <em>Five times do output this
message</em>, right? It does, and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why Rubyists love
using blocks.</p>

<p>One of the things that seem rather hard to grasp about blocks is that</p>

<ul>
<li>First, they are anonymous chunks of code.</li>
<li>Second, they are passed to methods just like other objects.</li>
<li>And third, they still can be called (just like methods), from inside the
method that it was passed to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Imagine you are the object that represents the number <code>5</code>. You are a number and
you do know your own value.</p>

<p>Now I hand you a piece of paper saying: <code>Please print the following on the
screen: &quot;Oh, hello!&quot;</code>, and I ask you to execute this instruction as many times
as the value that you know.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d go ahead and follow the instructions on the paper, and thus print out the
message. You repeat this 5 times, because <code>5</code> is the value that you know.</p>

<p>This is pretty much how the method <code>times</code> on numbers works, and how blocks
work: <code>times</code> takes the block (the instructions), and runs it as many times
as the value of the number.</p>

<p>To summarize: Methods can not only accept input in the form of objects passed
as arguments.  They can also accept this one special piece of input, which is
an anonymous block of code. And they can then call (execute) this block of code
in order to do useful things with it.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some other aspects of how blocks work next.</p>

  <h1>Alternative block syntaxes</h1>

<p>Next to the syntax shown before, using <code>do</code> and <code>end</code>, Ruby comes with an
alternative syntax, which uses curly braces for defining a block.</p>

<p>These two statements do exactly the same:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">times</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Oh, hello!"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">times</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"hello!"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Both statements define a block, which is passed to the method <code>times</code>. And
both blocks contain a single line of code.</p>

<p class="hint">
Blocks can be defined enclosing code in <code>do</code> and <code>end</code>,
or curly braces <code>{}</code>.
</p>

<p>So, when do you use one or the other syntax?</p>

<p>In the Ruby community there&rsquo;s the convention to use curly braces if you have a
single line block and it fits nicely on the same line (as, in our example, it
does).</p>

<p>Whenever you need to have more than one line in your block, then you use the
syntax using <code>do</code> and <code>end</code>. Sometimes people also use the <code>do</code> and <code>end</code>
syntax when they feel it makes the code more readable.</p>

<p class="hint">
Use curly braces <code>{}</code> for blocks, when the code fits on one line.
</p>

  <h1>Block arguments</h1>

<p>Blocks make a lot of sense on methods that are defined on collections like
arrays and hashes.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at some examples with arrays.</p>

<p>In our previous example that used the method <code>times</code> our block did not accept
an argument. A block that accepts an argument looks like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> was passed to the block"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And, again, this is the same as:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> was passed to the block"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>It is unknown to us why Matz has chosen to not enclose the argument list of
a block with round parentheses just like method argument lists. Instead, Ruby
wants us to use vertical bars (we call them &ldquo;pipes&rdquo;).</p>

<p>So, for blocks, <code>do |number|</code> is the same that is <code>def add_two (number)</code> for a
method definition, except that the method wants a name while a block is
anonymous: <code>|number|</code> and <code>(number)</code> both are argument lists. The first one
is used for blocks, the second one for methods.</p>

<p class="hint">
Block arguments are listed between pipes <code>|</code>, instead of parentheses.
</p>

<p>Now, when you run the code example above, you&rsquo;ll see the message printed out
for each of the numbers contained in the array.</p>

<p>Does that make sense? Again, our code almost reads like an English sentence:</p>

<p><em>With this array for each of its elements, naming it <code>number</code>, output the
following message.</em></p>

<p>The method <code>each</code> is defined on arrays, and it does just this:</p>

<p>It takes each of the elements in the array and calls the block, passing the
element as an argument. The block can then do whatever you want it to do with
the element. In our case we interpolate it into a string and print it out to
the screen.</p>

  <h1>Block return values</h1>

<p>Remember that we said a block returns a value just like methods do?  So far, in
our two examples above, we did not do anything with the return values of the
block.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example that does that:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">collect</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will take the array of numbers, and transform it into <em>another</em> array.</p>

<p>It does this by calling the method <code>collect</code> on the original array, which calls
the given block for each of the elements, and collects each of the return
values returned by the block. The resulting array is then returned by the
method <code>collect</code>, and printed to the screen.</p>

<p>In other words, the method <code>collect</code> uses the block as a transformer. It takes
each element of the array, passes it to the block in order to transform it
to something else, and then keeps all the transformed values in a <em>new</em> array
that the method <code>collect</code> then eventually returns.</p>

<p>Note that the method <code>collect</code> has an alias, which is <code>map</code>. These are exactly
the same methods. Many programmers prefer <code>map</code> over <code>collect</code> because it is
shorter, and also more commonly used in other languages. However, in our study
groups we use <code>collect</code> more often, because it simply expresses more clearly
what the method does.</p>

<p class="hint">
Use the method <code>collect</code> to transform an array into another array.
</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another example that uses the return value of the block, can you guess
what it does?</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">select</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">odd?</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the method <code>select</code> uses the block in a different way: as a
filter, or criterion, to select values out of the array, and then return a new
array with the selected values.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through this step by step, under the microscope:</p>

<ul>
<li>We create an array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>.</li>
<li>We then call the method <code>select</code> on it, and pass our block as a filter
criterion.</li>
<li>Now, the method <code>select</code> calls our block for each of the numbers.</li>
<li>It first calls the block passing the number <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>We now are inside the block, and a local variable <code>number</code> is assigned the
object that was passed as an argument, which is the number <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>Inside our block we now call the method <code>odd?</code> on this number, and of course,
because <code>1</code> is odd, this will return <code>true</code>.</li>
<li>Since this is the only, and thus, last statement in the body of our block,
our block also returns <code>true</code> to the method <code>select</code>. <code>select</code> therefore will
<em>keep</em> (&ldquo;select&rdquo;) the number <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>It then calls the block again, this time passing the number <code>2</code>. Of course,
because this is not an odd number, the method <code>odd?</code> and therfore our block
will return <code>false</code> back the the method <code>select</code>. Therefore it <em>discards</em> this
element.</li>
<li>It keeps doing this for each of the remaining elements in the array, and
eventually has this array: <code>[1, 3, 5]</code></li>
<li>The method <code>select</code> then returns this array and Ruby will pass it to the
method <code>p</code>, which prints the array out to the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the code above prints out <code>[1, 3, 5]</code>.</p>

<p class="hint">
Use the method <code>select</code> to select a new array with values that match a criteria defined by the block.
</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of a method that uses the block as a criterion:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">detect</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">even?</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Again, <code>detect</code> will pass each of the elements of the array to the block, one
by one, and check the return value of the block. However, as soon as the block
returns something truthy (something that is &ldquo;equivalent to true&rdquo;), the method
<code>detect</code> will return the current object itself. Therefore, this will print out
<code>2</code>: the first number in the array that is even.</p>

  <h1>Inversion of control</h1>

<p>In Ruby there are a lot more methods that accept blocks, and they do very
different things. However, they have one thing in common:</p>

<p>By accepting a block, from you as a programmer, the method can pass control to
you.</p>

<p>This design is an example for the principle of <em>inversion of control</em>, and
it&rsquo;s the real reason why Rubyists love blocks so much.</p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>In short it means that Matz, the creator of Ruby, put a tool in place that can
be used to allow methods to pass control to its users (i.e. you as a
programmer).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Control&rdquo; in this context refers to the question who gets to decide how things
work.</p>

<p>In older languages, where there was no such tool, people either had to
implement lots of very specific methods, and <em>guess</em> what users might need in
the future. Or they&rsquo;d decide to just not implement any of these methods at all.</p>

<p>For example, in Ruby, we don&rsquo;t have to define lots of methods like <code>select_odd</code>,
<code>select_even</code>, <code>select_lesser_than</code>, <code>select_greater_than</code> and so on, &hellip; where
each of these methods would be useful for one very specific usecase.</p>

<p>Instead, the class <code>Array</code> only has to implement one single, very generic
method for arrays: <code>select</code>. Since Ruby has blocks, the method can allow you
(as a programmer) to specify the criterion yourself: by passing a piece of
code, in the form of block to the method.</p>

<p>That way Ruby lets you, as a programmer, take over control, and specify what is
used as a criterion to select elements.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we mention this is because we think this is a nice example
of a pretty abstract principle applied to software design. There are lots of
other principles like these, and they&rsquo;ll make more and more sense to you over
time. Programming languages and code, from this perspective, is a subject of
design, and thus art, as well as social and cultural questions &hellip; much rather
than strictly logical or technical ones.</p>

  <h1>Iterators</h1>

<p>Methods on arrays and hashes that take a block are also called iterators.</p>

<p>We say they <em>iterate over the array</em>, meaning that these methods take each
element of the array and do something with it.</p>

<p>In Ruby iterators are &ldquo;chainable&rdquo;, adding functionality on top of each other.</p>

<p>That means that, if you do not pass a block to an iterator method, such as
<code>each</code>, <code>collect</code>, <code>select</code>, then you&rsquo;ll get an <em>iterator object</em> back. You can
then call more methods on these iterator objects, and finally pass a block.
Like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">collect</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">with_index</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">index</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">index</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">numbers</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will print out:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
</code></pre>

<p>What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>

<p>The method <code>with_index</code> can be called on any iterator object. All it does is
pass the index of the element within the array to the block, as a second block
argument, in addition to the element itself.</p>

<p>Inside of the block we can then use it, and add the index to the number itself.</p>

<p>So for the first iteration it will call the block with <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>, since <code>0</code> is
the first &ldquo;position&rdquo;, that is, index. It therefore returns <code>1</code>. For the second
iteration it calls the block with <code>2</code> and <code>1</code>, and returns <code>3</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>Therefore the method call eventually returns the array <code>[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]</code>.</p>

<p class="hint">
Iterators in Ruby are chainable.
</p>

  <h1>Conditionals</h1>

<p><em>If this is true, then do that. Otherwise do something else.</em></p>

<p>Often we want to check for a certain condition, and then based on it, do
either one thing or another. Or we want to do something only if a condition is
true.</p>

<p>All practical programming languages have some way of expressing this, and in
Ruby it looks like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">between?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The number is between 1 and 10"</span>
<span class="k">elsif</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">between?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The number is between 11 and 20"</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The number is bigger than 20"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You can probably guess what it does, and how it works, can&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through it one by one:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you run this code it will print out <code>The number is between 1 and 10</code>,
because the number assigned to the variable <code>number</code> on the first line is
<code>5</code>, and for this number the method call <code>number.between?(1, 10)</code> returns
<code>true</code>. Ruby will therefore execute the code in the <code>if</code> branch: The <code>if</code>
branch is the block of code that comes after the line with the <code>if</code>
statement, and that is indented by two spaces. Once it is done executing
the <code>if</code> branch Ruby will simply ignore the rest of the statement.</p></li>
<li><p>If you change the number <code>5</code> on the first line to <code>15</code>, and run the code
again, then it will print out <code>The number is between 11 and 20</code>. In this
case Ruby will, again, first check the first condition <code>number.between?(1,
10)</code>, but this time this method call returns <code>false</code>. Therefore, Ruby will
ignore the <code>if</code> branch, and check the next condition on the <code>elsif</code> line:
<code>number.between?(11, 20)</code>. Now, this method call returns true, because <code>5</code> is
between <code>11</code> and <code>20</code>. Ruby will therefore execute the <code>elsif</code> branch, and
print out this message. Again, once it is done executing the <code>elsif</code> branch
Ruby will ignore the rest of the statement.</p></li>
<li><p>If you now change the number <code>15</code> to <code>25</code>, and run the code again, then it
will print out <code>The number is bigger than 20</code>. Again, Ruby will first check
the first condition, and find it returns <code>false</code>. It will check the second
condition, which now also returns <code>false</code>. Therefore Ruby will then execute
the <code>else</code> branch, and print out that message.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>elsif</code> and <code>else</code> statements and branches are optional: you don&rsquo;t need to
have them. You can have an <code>if</code> statement without <code>elsif</code> or <code>else</code> branches,
an <code>if</code> statement only with an <code>else</code>, or you could have an <code>if</code> statement with
one or more <code>elsif</code> statements. Or combine all of them together:</p>

<ul>
<li>There <em>must</em> be an <code>if</code> statement and branch.</li>
<li>There <em>can</em> be many <code>elsif</code> statements and branches.</li>
<li>There <em>can</em> be one <code>else</code> statement and branch.</li>
</ul>

  <h1>Nothingness and the truth</h1>

<p>Now is a good time to talk about the concepts of nothingness and truth in Ruby.</p>

<h4>Nil</h4>

<p>We have briefly mentioned that in Ruby there is an object that represents
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo;: the object <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; is a thing in Ruby (as well as in many other
languages), albeit a very special one. We could ramble on the philosophical
implications of this, but instead we&rsquo;ll just look at how this is used in
practice:</p>

<p>Remember how we can receive a value associated with a key from a hash?</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:one</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:three</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:one</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will print out <code>&quot;eins&quot;</code>. However, what happens if we try to receive
the value for a key that has not been defined on the hash?</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:one</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:three</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:four</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will print out <code>nil</code>. Remember that every method call always will return
<em>some</em> value? In cases where there&rsquo;s nothing to return, it will return <code>nil</code>,
which represents nothing :)</p>

<p>In Ruby, <code>nil</code>, nothing, is something else than, for example, <code>0</code>, which
represents <em>something</em>. An empty string <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, an empty array <code>[]</code>, or empty
Hash <code>{}</code> also all represent <em>something</em>. So they&rsquo;re not <code>nil</code>.</p>

<h4>True and false</h4>

<p>We have also discussed that in order to represent truth, and the opposite of
it, Ruby also knows the values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>You have seen them when we tried some of the methods on numbers, strings and
arrays, like <code>3.odd?</code>, <code>&quot;a string&quot;.start_with?(&quot;a&quot;)</code>, or <code>[1, 2, 3].include?(2)</code>.</p>

<p>These so called predicate methods always return either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>

<p class="hint">
Predicate methods end with a question mark, and return <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>The objects <code>nil</code>, <code>true</code>, and <code>false</code> also have classes, and you can check
that in IRB yourself: <code>nil.class</code>, <code>true.class</code> and <code>false.class</code>.</p>

<p>For a reason that we don&rsquo;t know Matz (the creator of Ruby) has decided to call
these classes <code>NilClass</code>, <code>TrueClass</code> and <code>FalseClass</code>, instead of just <code>Nil</code>,
<code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. If you ever meet him at a conference you can ask him :)</p>

<h4>Truthiness and falsiness</h4>

<p>Now, when we talked about <code>if</code> statements we used methods that actually return
<code>true</code> and <code>false</code> values, like the <code>odd?</code> method on numbers does. Comparison
operators like <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> also return <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, as in:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The number </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> is greater than 5, or equal to 5"</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The number </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> is less than 5"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>However, what happens when we use methods as conditions that do not return
<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, but something else, for example a string, number, or <code>nil</code>?</p>

<p>For example, consider the following:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:one</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:three</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:four</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The dictionary defines a value for the key </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">."</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The dictionary does not define a value for the key </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">."</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As we saw before <code>dictionary[:four]</code> will return <code>nil</code> because this key is
not defined. Is <code>nil</code> equivalent to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>? Or will this raise
an error?</p>

<p>If you run the code above then you see that Ruby will execute the <code>else</code>
branch. That means Ruby actually considers <code>nil</code> to be equivalent to <code>not
true</code>, that is, <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Now, lets use a key that actually is defined:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:one</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:three</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:one</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The dictionary defines a value for the key </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">."</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The dictionary does not define a value for the key </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">."</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you saw before <code>dictionary[:one]</code> will return <code>&quot;eins&quot;</code>, because that&rsquo;s the
value associated with the key <code>:one</code>. Again, do you think <code>&quot;eins&quot;</code> is
equivalent to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>? Or will this raise an error instead?</p>

<p>If you run the code then you&rsquo;ll see that Ruby now executes the <code>if</code> branch, and
considers the condition (i.e. the string <code>&quot;eins&quot;</code>) to be equivalent to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Think about this for second: Ruby considers <em>everything</em> to be equivalent to
<code>true</code> that is <em>not</em> <code>false</code> or <code>nil</code>. Or put the other way around, Ruby only
considers <code>nil</code> to be equivalent to <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Because &ldquo;is equivalent to true&rdquo; or &ldquo;is equivalent to false&rdquo; is quite a clunky
thing to repeat so often the programming community has come up with terms for
this: truthiness and falsiness. So we can say that the string <code>&quot;eins&quot;</code> is
truthy. And <code>nil</code> is the only other thing that is falsy in Ruby, except
<code>false</code> itself.</p>

<p>To sum this up, <code>if</code> and <code>unless</code> look at the truthiness of a the value
that is returned by the condition. Everything except <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> is
truthy, including strings, numbers, arrays, hashes, and every other object.</p>

<p>This also includes the number <code>0</code>, empty strings <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, arrays <code>[]</code> and hashes
<code>{}</code>. These aren&rsquo;t nothing (<code>nil</code>), instead they&rsquo;re something, and therefore,
in Ruby, truthy.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a pattern that you  might see used when you look at other people&rsquo;s code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">dictionary</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:one</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"eins"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"zwei"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:three</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"drei"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:one</span>
<span class="n">translation</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">dictionary</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">translation</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The translation for </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> is: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">translation</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">."</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"The dictionary does not define a translation for the key </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">."</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If you read this out loud, does it make sense to you?</p>

<p>The code first looks up the translation from the <code>dictionary</code> hash. And then it
says <em>If there&rsquo;s a translation, then use it. Otherwise do something else.</em></p>

<p>Ruby&rsquo;s concept of truthiness allows us to write our code in this concise way
that almost reads like English. And that&rsquo;s one reason why many people love Ruby
so much.</p>

  <h1>Operators</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;ve already used some arithmetic operators (<code>+</code> and <code>*</code>) above. You have
also learned that operators, under the hood, are just methods. Ruby just
adds a little bit of syntax sugar on top of these methods, so they&rsquo;re sweeter
to read, and write.</p>

<p>There also are operators for comparing things, for logical calculations, and
other operations. Let talk about some more of them.</p>

  <h1>Arithmetical operators</h1>

<p>For numbers, the operators <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> obviously mean the mathematical
operations of adding and multiplying two numbers. Of course there are other
arithmetical operators. Here&rsquo;s a full list:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>+</code> - addition</li>
<li><code>-</code> - subtraction</li>
<li><code>*</code> - multiplication</li>
<li><code>/</code> - division</li>
<li><code>**</code> - exponentiation</li>
<li><code>%</code> - modulus (the rest of a division, e.g. <code>5 % 2</code> returns <code>1</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, some of these methods are also defined on other objects, like strings
and arrays.</p>

<p>Try it yourself in IRB:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;3"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"!"</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;3!"</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;3"</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, these operators mean something different for strings. But they
also make sense, don&rsquo;t they?</p>

<p>Adding one string to another just means that they will be concatenated into one
longer string. And multiplying a string by a number means repeating it as many
times.</p>

<p>The same works for arrays:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Again, adding two arrays means combining them into one big array. And
multiplying an array with a number means getting a big array with the original
elements repeated.</p>

  <h1>Logical operators</h1>

<p>Logical operators are also, maybe more commonly, called boolean operators.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;boolean&rdquo; originates from the book &ldquo;The Mathemetical Analysis of
Logic&rdquo; written by George Boole in 1847. Boolean logic has been fundamental in
the development of computers, and programming, since at their core, computers
are all about processing whether or not there is current flow: on vs off
(true vs false).</p>

<p>If you are curious, feel encouraged to google and read up on this online, but
for now, we can simply look at the 3 fundamental boolean operators and
what they do: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.</p>

<p>The operator <code>and</code> returns <code>true</code> if, and only if, both values also are <code>true</code>.
So, only the expression <code>true and true</code> is also <code>true</code>. All of the expressions
<code>true and false</code>, <code>false and true</code>, <code>false and false</code> evaluate to <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>If you think about this, and come up with English sentences, then this will
make a lot of sense: <em>At the restaurant I&rsquo;ll have a tomato soup IF it is vegan
AND they still have some.</em></p>

<p>The operator <code>or</code> on the other hand returns <code>true</code> if at least one of the
values is <code>true</code>. So, only if both values are <code>false</code>, the operator returns
<code>false</code>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why it is logically correct to answer the question <em>Would you like tea
or coffee for breakfeast?</em> with <em>Yes, please.</em> IF you&rsquo;d like either tea, or
coffee, or both. You&rsquo;d only say <em>Hell, no!</em> if you&rsquo;d like an orange juice
instead :)</p>

<p>The operator <code>not</code> simply returns the negated, opposite value. <code>not true</code>
returns <code>false</code>, and <code>not false</code> returns <code>true</code>. Therefore, the following
lines of code are the same:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Always true"</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">not</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Always true"</span> <span class="k">unless</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Each of these three operators comes in two versions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>and</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code></li>
<li><code>or</code> and <code>||</code></li>
<li><code>not</code> and <code>!</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The difference between them has to do with what is called &ldquo;operator precedence&rdquo;.</p>

<p>From math you know that <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> evaluates to <code>7</code>, not <code>9</code>. This is
because the multiplication <code>*</code> operator binds stronger, and precedes the
addition operator <code>+</code>. In other words <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> is same as <code>1 + (2 * 3)</code>, and
not the same as <code>(1 + 2) * 3</code>.</p>

<p>In Ruby, the operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, and <code>!</code> bind stronger than, and thus precede
their fellows <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.</p>

  <h1>Comparison operators</h1>

<p>In order to compare things Ruby has a bunch of comparison operators.</p>

<p>The operator <code>==</code> returns true if both objects can be considered the same. For
example <code>1 == 1 * 1</code> will return <code>true</code>, because the numbers on both sides
represent the same value. The expression <code>&quot;A&quot; == &quot;A&quot;</code> also returns <code>true</code>
because both strings have the same value.</p>

<p>Likewise, two arrays are equivalent when they contain the same elements, in the
same order. For example <code>[1, 2] == [1, 2]</code> will return <code>true</code>, but <code>[1, 2] ==
[2, 3]</code> and <code>[1, 2] == [2, 1]</code> both will return <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Note that we say &ldquo;considered the same&rdquo; and &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; because technically the
two objects do not have to be (and most often, as in our examples) are not the
same objects.  E.g. while evaluating the expression <code>&quot;A&quot; == &quot;A&quot;</code> Ruby will
actually create two different string objects which both contain a single
character <code>A</code>.</p>

<p>In practice this is almost always what you want. For the rare case when you
actually need to check if two objects are the same object there&rsquo;s the method
<code>equal?</code>. E.g., <code>&quot;A&quot;.equal?(&quot;A&quot;)</code> returns <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Other comparison operators are: less than <code>&lt;</code> , less than or equal <code>&lt;=</code>, greater than <code>&gt;</code>,
and greater than or equal <code>&gt;=</code>. They also work on numbers and strings, in the way
you&rsquo;ll expect it. Open IRB and try a few combinations on numbers and strings.</p>

<p>Comparison operators most often are used in order to formulate conditions
in <code>if</code> statements. Like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">20</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> is greater than 10."</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The most funny operator in Ruby is <code>&lt;=&gt;</code>, because it&rsquo;s called the spaceship
operator. No kidding :) It is rather rarely used, and it is useful for
implementing custom ways of sorting things.</p>

  <h1>Operators are methods</h1>

<p>As you have seen a number has methods named like the arithmetic operators <code>+</code>,
<code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>. That&rsquo;s right! Interesting.</p>

<p>If you think about this, it makes sense: If everything is an object then
numbers are objects. If &ldquo;doing things&rdquo; means operating with methods by the way
of calling them, then what would <code>+</code> be? A method of course.</p>

<p>But if we call methods on objects using that dot <code>.</code> notation, then where are
the dots in <code>2 + 3 * 4</code>?</p>

<p>The trick is: Ruby adds them for you, silently. If you write the following code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Then Ruby will translate this to the following:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">+</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Fun, isn&rsquo;t it? These operators are all methods on numbers, and they can be
called just like any other method. (The same is true for lots of other
operators, as you can see in IRB, when you run <code>1.methods.sort</code>.) The code
above is valid Ruby code, and both lines do exactly the same.</p>

<p>Ruby just adds a little bit of syntax in order to make it easier to read and
write for us: It allows us to write <code>number = 2 + 3 * 4</code> instead of <code>number =
2.+(3.*(4))</code>, which is a pretty nasty thing to type.</p>

<p>This is something called &ldquo;syntax sugar&rdquo;, because it makes the language more
sweet (no kidding).</p>

<p>By the way, this works the same way for other things too.</p>

<p>For example, you have learned about the array and hash syntax that uses square
brackets <code>[]</code> for reading and writing.</p>

<p>Ruby translates this code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">array</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">array</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="nb">hash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:one</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'eins'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:two</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'zwei'</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nb">hash</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:three</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'drei'</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="nb">hash</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:three</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>to these method calls:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">array</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">[</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre>

<p>Knowing this can be useful when you want to write classes that look and feel
similar to arrays or hashes, but behave differently.</p>

  <h1>String interpolation</h1>

<p>As mentioned above you can stick strings together by using the <code>+</code> operator.</p>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Ada"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hello, "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"!"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This, of course, will output the message <code>Hello, Ada!</code>.</p>

<p>Glueing strings together like this works, and you can do it. However, there is
another method of accomplishing the same, and it is widely used, and usually
preferred over concatenating strings with <code>+</code>.</p>

<p>This method is called &ldquo;string interpolation&rdquo;, and this is how it looks:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Ada"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hello, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">!"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Using this syntax everything between the opening <code>#{</code> and closing <code>}</code> bits is
evaluated as Ruby code, and the result of this evaluation will be <em>embedded
into</em> the string surrounding it.</p>

<p>In other words, when Ruby finds <code>#{name}</code> in this string, then it will
evaluate the piece of Ruby code <code>name</code>. It finds that this is a variable, so it
returns the value of the variable, which is the string <code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code>. So it embeds it
into the surrounding string <code>&quot;Hello, #{name}!&quot;</code>, by replacing <code>#{name}</code>.</p>

<p>Now we can also finally explain the difference between strings created with
single and double quotes:</p>

<p>String interpolation only works with double quotes.</p>

<p>That means that:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Interpolation works in double quoted strings: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">."</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">'And it does not work in single quoted strings: #{1 + 2}.'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>will print out:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Interpolation works in double quoted strings: 3.
And it does not work in single quoted strings: #{1 + 2}.
</code></pre>

<p>If you type the code above in your editor, and syntax highlighting for Ruby
code is used, it should highlight the code in the double quoted string, so it
gives you a visual clue about the interpolation.</p>

<p>So, why do people prefer string interpolation?</p>

<p>First of all, again, it&rsquo;s slightly fewer letters to type. In our example, that&rsquo;s
just 5 characters, no big deal. However, consider a longer string, which is
constructed using three, four, or more variables. Now this extra space quickly
adds up, and things wouldn&rsquo;t fit nicely on a single line anymore.</p>

<p>Also, many people find that the syntax reads a bit better. There&rsquo;s a little bit
less clutter, making it a little bit easier to see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>One other, albeit pretty negligible reason is, that string interpolation
actually uses less resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The code <code>&quot;Hello, #{name}!&quot;</code> creates one single new string object, and then
embeds the existing string <code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code> into it.</p></li>
<li><p>The code <code>&quot;Hello, &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;</code> on the other hand creates 3 new string
objects: first it creates the string <code>&quot;!&quot;</code>, and passes it to the method <code>+</code>
on the existing string <code>&quot;Ada&quot;</code>.  The operator <code>+</code> returns a <em>new</em> string,
which now is <code>&quot;Ada!&quot;</code>.  Now this string is passed to the method <code>+</code> on
<code>&quot;Hello, &quot;</code>, which again, creates a <em>new</em> string, <code>&quot;Hello, Ada!&quot;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, string concatenation creates 2 more string objects even in our simple
example. These intermediate objects are immediately discarded, because they&rsquo;re
not used any more. We&rsquo;re only interested in the final result <code>&quot;Hello, Ada!&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>We recommend you get used to using string interpolation, just because this
is what most developers use.</p>

<h4>Escape sequences</h4>

<p>There&rsquo;s one other little difference between single and double-quoted string
that we should mention while we&rsquo;re at it.</p>

<p>In programming, strings can not only contain text as we normally think about
it. They can also contain <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Control_character">control characters</a>.
Control characters are also called &ldquo;non-printing&rdquo; characters, even though
they can have visual effects.</p>

<p>Control characters can represent all sorts of things, such as removing
the last character (&ldquo;backspace&rdquo;), the next one (&ldquo;delete&rdquo;), or even causing
an auditable alert (&ldquo;bell&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The one most typically used in Ruby programs is the &ldquo;newline&rdquo; character.</p>

<p>Because there&rsquo;s no way to represent a &ldquo;newline&rdquo; character using any of the
keys on your keyboard programmers have come up with the idea of <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Escape_sequences_in_C">escape
sequences</a>: An escape
sequence is a code that consists of a backslash and another character,
and this combination is used in place of control characters.</p>

<p>For example, <code>\n</code> is the escape sequence that stands for the &ldquo;newline&rdquo;
character.</p>

<p>So this code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"one</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">two</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">three"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Will print out:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>one
two
three
</code></pre>

<p>Now, escape sequences also only work in double quoted strings. If you
try to use them in a single quoted string like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">'one\ntwo\nthree'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>then that will print out the string literally:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>one\ntwo\nthree
</code></pre>

<p>Which means that escape sequences are not replaced in single quoted strings.</p>

  <h1>Top-level object</h1>

<p>So, we&rsquo;ve learned that objects come with lots of methods attached to them.  And
we&rsquo;ve seen how we can use them to do interesting things with the object, by the
way of calling these methods.</p>

<p>Now, if you pop into <code>irb</code>, or if you write the following code into an otherwise
empty Ruby file, this works:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">is_a?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Object</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="kp">true</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">methods</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:to_s</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:inspect</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">.</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So, as you can see we can use some methods in Ruby without even defining an
object at all: They&rsquo;re already there. And the method <code>is_a?</code> tells us that this
already is an object &hellip; whatever &ldquo;this&rdquo; is.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s up with that?</p>

<p>This is something that pretty much blows some people&rsquo;s minds, confuses the heck
out of others, while yet others don&rsquo;t even notice or think about it at all. It
is also something, that, when you ask around on your local Ruby meetup, very
few people can explain in a satisfying, and clear way. And neither do we, yet.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s still try.</p>

<p>Whenever you open IRB and it presents that prompt to you, or when you create a
new, empty Ruby file &hellip; Ruby will not only execute your code: Before she does
she first creates an empty, anonymous Object, and kind of places you inside of
it.</p>

<p>This empty Object kind of seems invisible, and it seems that those methods
that we can define in this scope (space) were somehow &ldquo;standing alone&rdquo;. In fact
they aren&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re defined on this empty, anonymous Object that we usually
don&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p>This Object often is referred to as the <em>top-level scope</em> in Ruby.</p>

<p class="hint">
The top-level scope is an empty, anonymous object. All Ruby code starts in here.
</p>

<p>Confusing? Yeah. Don&rsquo;t worry. This is something many Ruby programmers do and
use everyday without ever asking the question why it works, exactly.</p>

<p>Hopefully some of this will become more clear once you&rsquo;ve written your
own methods and classes.</p>

  <h1>Lots of other methods</h1>

<p>If you look at the methods that are defined on strings and arrays (e.g. run
<code>[].methods.sort</code> or <code>{}.methods.sort</code> in IRB), then you&rsquo;ll find quite a bunch
of method names that look like they are doing exactly what their names
describe.</p>

<p>For example, some of the things you can do with strings are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&quot;a string&quot;.capitalize</code> returns <code>&quot;A string&quot;</code>, with the first letter uppercased.</li>
<li><code>&quot;a string&quot;.length</code> returns <code>8</code>, which is the length of the string.</li>
<li><code>&quot;a string&quot;.start_with?(&quot;a&quot;)</code> returns <code>true</code>, because the string starts with an <code>&quot;a&quot;</code>.</li>
<li><code>&quot;a string&quot;.include?(&quot;s&quot;)</code> returns <code>true</code>, because the string contains the character <code>&quot;s&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples for useful methods on arrays are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[5, 1, 3].sort</code> returns another array, with the elements sorted: <code>[1, 3, 5]</code>.</li>
<li><code>[5, 1, 3].size</code> returns <code>3</code>, the number of elements in the array.</li>
<li><code>[1, 1, 1, 2].uniq</code> returns a new array with duplicate elements removed: <code>[1, 2]</code>.</li>
<li><code>[1, 2, 3].join(&quot;, &quot;)</code> returns a string <code>&quot;1, 2, 3&quot;</code>.</li>
<li><code>[1, 2, 3].include?(2)</code> returns true because the array contains the number <code>2</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>How do you find all these methods?</p>

<p>The quickest way to find a certain method for an object often is to just ask
Google: &ldquo;ruby array sort&rdquo;. That will point you to the Ruby documentation.
Another way is to read through all the methods for the class on the respective
Ruby documentation page. And of course, you can also read through the method
names returned by <code>[1, 2, 3].methods.sort</code>.</p>

  <h1>Questions and commands</h1>

<p>Generally speaking, methods play one of two roles: They either answer a question,
or they perform a command.</p>

<p>For example, if we have a <code>user</code> object, and users have a name, then we would
ask the user object for its name by calling the method <code>name</code>: <code>user.name</code>
would return the user&rsquo;s name. Arrays know their size (how many elements they
have), so we can ask an array: <code>[1, 2, 3].size</code> will return <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>Another example is the method <code>sort</code> on arrays. This method does not actually
sort the array that it is called on. Instead it returns a <em>new</em> array with the
same values, but in a sorted order:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">array</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">sort</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">array</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will output <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> and then <code>[3, 2, 1]</code>. So we see that the original
array is still the same.</p>

<p>Often questions need another bit of information passed. E.g., we can ask
a string <em>Do you start with this character?</em>, and we&rsquo;ll need to pass the
character that we are talking about: <code>&quot;a string&quot;.start_with?(&quot;a&quot;)</code>. The answer
to this question will be <code>true</code>. Or if we ask an array if it includes a certain
element, then of course we need to pass that element, as in <code>[1, 2,
3].include?(1)</code></p>

<p>The other role that a method can play is being responsible for executing a
certain command.</p>

<p>For example in Rails objects that can be stored to the database have a method
<code>save</code>. Of course, the purpose of this method is to save the object to the
database. E.g. <code>user.save</code> would save some changes that we&rsquo;ve made to the user
before, like, maybe we have given them a new password.</p>

<p>Another example is the method <code>sort!</code> on arrays. Different from the method
<code>sort</code> (without an exclamation mark), this method tells the array to sort
itself:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">array</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">sort!</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">array</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If you run this code, then it will print out <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>: the array is now
sorted.</p>

<p>Another example for a method that is a command is the method <code>puts</code>. All it
does is print something to the screen, and it always returns <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>Whenever you think about adding a new method to your code it makes sense to
think about the role the method should have. Is it a question? Or a command?</p>

  <h1>Alternative Syntax</h1>

<p>You have, so far, learned that Strings are defined using single or double
quotes, like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="s2">"A String"</span>
<span class="s1">'Another String'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And Arrays are defined using square brackes, with a comma separated list of
objects, like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"One"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Two"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Three"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;d like to quickly mention two alternative syntaxes for defining the same
objects, even though they&rsquo;re not used very often. However, you may sometimes
find them in other people&rsquo;s code, so it&rsquo;s useful to know they exist.</p>

<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>First, Ruby has an alternative syntax for defining strings that goes like so:</p>

<p><code>%[any-character]The actual string[the same character]</code></p>

<p>Meaning, that when there&rsquo;s a percentage character <code>%</code> followed by any other
character, which also closes the whole thing, then this defines a string, too.</p>

<p>For examples these definitions all mean exactly the same:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="s2">"A String"</span>
<span class="s1">'A String'</span>
<span class="sx">%(A String)</span>
<span class="sx">%{A String}</span>
<span class="sx">%|A String|</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Which character is used to open and close the string is a matter of style, and
preference. The author of this text prefers round paratheses for readability,
but others prefer curly braces or pipes. There&rsquo;s no very clear convention in
the Ruby community.</p>

<p>When would you use this alternative syntax?</p>

<p>Sometimes you need to define a string that itself contains (or may contain, in
future versions) the same quote character that you&rsquo;ve used to define the string.
For example, if you have a string that contains the string <code>&quot;Name&quot;</code>, including
the quotes, but in the same string you&rsquo;d also like to use
<a href="string_interpolation.html">String interpolation</a>, so you&rsquo;d normally
use double quotes to define the string. In that case you&rsquo;d need to escape the
double quotes that are contained in your string.</p>

<p>It probably helps to look at an example. Imagine you&rsquo;re working on an
application that asks the user for an email address, validates the format of
the given address, and then displays an error message if the format looks
invalid:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>The given email address "ruby@monstas" does not look like a valid email address.
</code></pre>

<p>Using double quotes your code might look like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">address</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"ruby@monstas"</span>
<span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"The given email address </span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">address</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2"> does not look like a valid email address."</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">message</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Try running this code, and then also try removing the backslashes, and running
it again. You&rsquo;ll get a syntax error message because Ruby thinks the second
double quote (after <code>address</code>) closes the first one, so it would look at
<code>#{...}</code> outside of a string, which is not valid Ruby.</p>

<p>While the above code, including the backslash characters, is valid Ruby code,
it looks a little ugly. Typing this stuff is kinda cumbersome, and programmers
usually hate it.</p>

<p>So Ruby gives us another, nicer way to express the same:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sx">%(The given email address "#{address}" does not look like a valid email address.)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Also, this allows us to freely change the message later, without having to
change the quotes. For example, if our original message would have looked like
so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sx">%(The given email address does not look like a valid email address.)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>We could now change it to say the following without changing the quotes:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sx">%(The given email address doesn't look like a valid email address.)</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Arrays</h2>

<p>Imagine you are running a programming study group, and you want to quickly
write a piece of code that runs a little raffle to assign people to pairs
randomly.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">people</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="s2">"Anne"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Elizabeth"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Erica"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Iryna"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Johanna"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Juliane"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Katja"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Katrin"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Maria"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Renate"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Sureka"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Miriam"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Zazie"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"Anja"</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">people</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">shuffle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each_slice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">pair</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">pair</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">', '</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Well, this code works. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool to be able to define the array
without having to write out all those quotes and commas? They&rsquo;re quite
cumbersome to type, aren&rsquo;t they? Also, if we could omit them then we could just
copy and paste that list of names from some where else, without modifying it
further.</p>

<p>Luckily, Ruby provides us with a piece of syntax that does exactly this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">people</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sx">%w(
  Anne
  Elizabeth
  Erica
  Iryna
  Johanna
  Juliane
  Katja
  Katrin
  Maria
  Renate
  Sureka
  Miriam
  Zazie
  Anja
)</span>
<span class="n">people</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">shuffle</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each_slice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">pair</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">pair</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">', '</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>w</code> in <code>%w(...)</code> stands for &ldquo;words&rdquo;, which means an array defined like this
will always only contain strings. So, <code>%w(1 2 3 4)</code> would result in the same
array as <code>[&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;]</code>.</p>

  <h1>Using the right words</h1>

<p><em>Naming things is hard</em></p>

<p>Just like programmers are obsessed about formatting, they also care a lot
about how to name the things they create.</p>

<p>Choosing good names for your variables, methods, and classes is important,
because this makes your code more expressive and easy to read. In fact, once
you&rsquo;ve learned the basic concepts of Ruby, well crafted code will read almost
like a prose text to you.  Not necessarily like your favorite novel, but maybe
like a recipe or other instructional prose. Ruby is particularly great for
writing expressive, readable code.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of great, and rather bad names to pick.</p>

<p>Consider this code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Email</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">string2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">headers_hash</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="c1"># more methods ...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">an_email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hi there, Ruby Monstas!"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"2015-01-02"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Ferdous"</span> <span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre>

<p>From looking at the first two lines of this code you can figure out that the
author defines an Email class, and it takes 3 arguments, two of which probably
are supposed to be strings, and one is a hash containing some headers.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s the purpose of the first two arguments? All we know the author wants them
to be strings. So we might have to consult the documentation, or look at examples
using the class. Luckily we can find an example at the very bottom of the file, and
see that the first argument is supposed to be the subject, while the second one is
a date.</p>

<p>Using the &ldquo;type&rdquo; of an object as a variable name, or part of a variable name,
usually is not a very good idea: <code>string</code>, <code>array</code>, <code>hash</code> often are bad names,
except in contexts where the type of the object is all that matters. One example
for such a context is the method definition <code>def encrypt(string)</code> in the
<a href="/advanced/modules.html">Modules</a> chapter.</p>

<p>In our case it makes sense to name these arguments <code>subject</code> and <code>date</code> in the
first place, in order to make it easier for others to understand the purpose of
these arguments:</p>

<p>When you tell your non-programmer friends that &ldquo;An email requires two strings
and a hash of headers.&rdquo;, they&rsquo;d probably stare at you weird and switch to
another topic.  When you instead say &ldquo;An email requires a subject, a date, and
some headers&rdquo; then they might roughly understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s rename them:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Email</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">subject</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">headers</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hi there, Ruby Monstas!"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"2015-01-02"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Ferdous"</span> <span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the first argument name <code>str</code> in the first example is an abbreviation,
which is something that isn&rsquo;t very common in the Ruby world. People used to use
abbreviated variable names back when memory was extremely sparse, and
expensive: longer variable names would consume more memory. Nowadays there&rsquo;s
just no reason any more to make your fellow developers puzzle over abbreviated
names. Consider <code>var</code>, <code>var1</code>, <code>var_2</code> bad names, and instead use names that
reveal (talk about) your intentions, and their purpose.</p>

<p>Did you notice the local variable name <code>an_email</code> in the first example? The
name <code>email</code> in the second example also is much better in most situations. The
prefix <code>an_</code> doesn&rsquo;t add any kind of information. It&rsquo;s just noisy, and adds
clutter.</p>

<p>Another example:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">emailslist</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="no">Email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hi there, Ruby Monstas!"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"2015-01-02"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Ferdous"</span> <span class="p">}),</span>
  <span class="no">Email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Keep on coding! :)"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"2015-01-03"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Dajana"</span> <span class="p">})</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">emailslist</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">mail</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">mail</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">subject</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Again, <code>list</code> says something about the type. Why not just call it <code>emails</code>. The
plural already says that it&rsquo;s some kind of list.</p>

<p>Also, the block argument <code>mail</code> deviates from the class name <code>Email</code>, and the
variable name <code>emails</code> &hellip; and thus might raise a question &ldquo;Wait, is this a
<code>mail</code> maybe something different from an <code>email</code> in this code?&rdquo;. So why not
avoid confusion like that in the first place and call it <code>email</code> &hellip; simply
the singular form of the name of the collection <code>emails</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">emails</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="no">Email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hi there, Ruby Monstas!"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"2015-01-02"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Ferdous"</span> <span class="p">}),</span>
  <span class="no">Email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Keep on coding! :)"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"2015-01-03"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Dajana"</span> <span class="p">})</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">emails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">subject</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The section &ldquo;Naming variables&rdquo; in this chapter of
<a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#2.-variables">Ruby in 100 Minutes</a>
also has a couple great examples of good vs bad names.</p>

<p>Also, even though these examples are talking about local variables, the same
reasoning applies to method names, class names, &hellip; basically any name that you pick.</p>

<p>Great names reveal your intention while you write this code. They talk about
the purpose of your code, and explain things to your fellow developers.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;re curious to read more about this, here is an interesting presentation on
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pirhilton/how-to-name-things-the-hardest-problem-in-programming">How to name things</a>
as well as a blog post on what programmers find the
<a href="http://www.itworld.com/article/2833265/cloud-computing/don-t-go-into-programming-if-you-don-t-have-a-good-thesaurus.html">hardest tasks</a>
they face (guess what, it&rsquo;s naming things &hellip;).</p>

  <h1>Arguments and parentheses</h1>

<p>If you have read carefully, you may have noticed that we said about the code
<code>puts 5</code> that <code>puts</code> is a method call. And then later we&rsquo;ve enclosed the value
<code>3</code> in parentheses when calling the method: <code>add_two(3)</code>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right:</p>

<p class="hint">
In Ruby, when you define or call (execute, use) a method, you can omit the
parentheses.
</p>

<p>So these lines mean exactly the same:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hello!"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And so do these:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">add_two</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="n">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And all of these:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">add_two</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">add_two</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So when do you use parentheses, and when do you omit them?</p>

<p>There is no clear rule about this, but there are some conventions. For now,
you can just stick with the convention we are using at our study groups, which
is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use parentheses for all method calls that take arguments, except for the
methods <code>puts</code> and <code>p</code> (and later: <code>require</code> and <code>include</code>).</li>
<li>If a method does not take any arguments, then do not add empty parentheses,
omit them.</li>
</ul>

<p>So the idiomatic way to write the line above is:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Methods without arguments</h2>

<p>Also, so far we&rsquo;ve only mentioned that sometimes methods do not take any arguments.
But we haven&rsquo;t looked at an example so far.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Oh, hello!"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">greet</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The first three lines define a method, and we&rsquo;ve picked the name <code>greet</code> for it.
Again, the method body contains just a single line.</p>

<p>The last line consists of nothing but the word <code>greet</code>. When Ruby runs this code,
and it finds the word <code>greet</code> it will know that this refers to the method defined
earlier, and call it.</p>

<p>So Ruby jumps into the method body (this time it does not bring any objects with
it as arguments, because our method does not need any). It then executes the line
<code>puts &quot;Oh, hello!&quot;</code> which prints a greeting to the screen.</p>

<p>As you can see we do not use any parentheses here. We could do that. The following
code would be perfectly valid, and do exactly the same:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Oh, hello!"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">greet</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre>

<p>However since we can omit the parentheses in this case we do just that. They
just add visual noise and make the code slightly less readable.</p>

<h2>Returning nil</h2>

<p>Also, you might wonder what&rsquo;s going on with the return value our our <code>greet</code>
method. We just said that every method call always returns &ldquo;something&rdquo; (an
object).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. The method call <code>greet</code> will return the object returned from the
last evaluated statement (which, in our case, is <code>puts &quot;Oh, hello!&quot;</code>).</p>

<p>What do you think that is?</p>

<p>The method <code>puts</code> always returns <code>nil</code> (because it was written that way): Its
purpose is to print something to the screen, not return something interesting.
It&rsquo;s a <a href="questions_commands.html">command, not a question</a>. So the most
sensible choice for a return value is <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>So where does the <code>nil</code> object go?</p>

<p>If you look at our example code you notice that we don&rsquo;t do anything with the
return value of the method call <code>greet</code>: We don&rsquo;t assign it to a variable. And
we don&rsquo;t pass it to another method call. In fact, we simply discard it since
we&rsquo;re not interested it in.</p>

<p>In our example that&rsquo;s just fine. In practice you should always be aware <em>why</em>
you are calling a certain method. Is it a command like <em>Please print this</em>?
Then you probably aren&rsquo;t interested in the return value and you can discard
it as we&rsquo;ve done above. Or is it a more like a question <em>What&rsquo;s the result
when you add 2 to this number?</em> In that case obviously you want to use
the return value later.</p>

<p>For the sake of demonstrating that <code>puts</code> and <code>greet</code> indeed return <code>nil</code>
we can use <code>p</code> to inspect the return value like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>   <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Oh, hello!"</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">greet</span>
<span class="no">Oh</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hello!</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Here we go. The <code>=&gt;</code> thing in IRB signals that this is the return value. As you
can see it first prints the greeting (using <code>puts</code>) and then, after returning
from the method, outputs the <code>nil</code> value.</p>

  <h1>Terminology: Arguments vs Parameters</h1>

<p>We should mention that we are slightly simplifying terminology here. We
conflate two terms that normally would be defined separately: We simply use the
term &ldquo;argument&rdquo; for both the variable names that are defined in the arguments
list of the method definition, and the value that is passed as part of the
method call.</p>

<p>In programming, normally the &ldquo;argument list&rdquo; is called a &ldquo;parameter list&rdquo;
instead, and a single name on it is called a &ldquo;parameter&rdquo;. On the other hand,
only the objects passed when calling the method are referred to as &ldquo;arguments&rdquo;.</p>

<p>E.g. in the code &hellip;</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">add_two</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; the word <code>number</code> in the first line is a &ldquo;parameter&rdquo;, whereas <code>3</code> in the
last line is an &ldquo;argument&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We found making this distinction in our beginners classes unnecessarily
confusing, and thus ignore it. We simply call both these things &ldquo;arguments&rdquo;,
and point out that they create a local variable inside of the method body.</p>

<p>So, now you know :)</p>

  <h1>Writing a new method</h1>

<p>As programmers we like to split up our tasks, and do one thing after another.
This allows us to focus on one small task, and once we&rsquo;ve solved it, we move on
to the next one.</p>

<p>When you need to add some new functionality to your program you&rsquo;ll often
find yourself thinking &ldquo;I should add a method for this&rdquo;: methods add behaviour.</p>

<p>Now, the first thing you should ask yourself is: &ldquo;What is it that this method
should do?&rdquo; The answer to this gives you a hint for a good method name.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are working on an application that deals with emails, and the
thing you are trying to accomplish is formatting an email. So your method name
can be <code>format_email</code>.</p>

<p>With this first task solved, knowing the method name, you can already go ahead
and write down the method definition:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">format_email</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>While this is a pretty useless method, since it does nothing at all, it already
<em>is</em> a valid method. So that&rsquo;s good progress already: you&rsquo;ve made the first
step.</p>

<p>The next question to ask is: &ldquo;Does this method need to be given any information
in order to do its thing?&rdquo; The answer to this question specifies the method&rsquo;s
arguments list.</p>

<p>In our example, the answer probably is that, in order to format an email, it
needs the email.</p>

<p>So you can now add the argument list to the method:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">format_email</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>With these two things solved you can now start thinking about implementing
the method body. How can you transform the email into some formatted text?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d add a new line between <code>def</code> and <code>end</code>, and make sure it&rsquo;s indented by
two spaces (hit <code>tab</code>, unless your editor does it for you), and start focussing
on the code that makes up the method body:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">format_email</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">.</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You see how we&rsquo;ve split up the task of writing a new method into three smaller
tasks, and worked on each one of them after another.</p>

<p>Even though this might seem trivial at first, we recommend you get into this
habit, too.</p>

<p>Btw, good editors help you format things. For example, when you are on a
line that starts with <code>def something</code>, and at the end of the line hit return,
Sublime will already indent the next line for you by 2 spaces. If you now type
<code>end</code>, then Sublime will notice that you are closing the method, and outdent
it again, so <code>def</code> and <code>end</code> sit on the same level. Smart, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Also, you&rsquo;ll notice that when you type an opening parenthesis <code>(</code>, then Sublime
will add a closing one <code>)</code> too, but keep your cursor placed between them, so
you can type the argument list where it belongs.</p>

<p>Exercises: Now would be a good time to do some of the <a href="../exercises/methods_1.html">exercises on
methods</a>.</p>

  <h1>Advanced Topics</h1>

  <h1>Using Libraries (1)</h1>

<p>Our <code>Person</code> class does not define an attribute accessor method for its
password, and thus, others cannot ask for and retrieve it.</p>

<p>However, our person object could freely give them an encrypted version of it.</p>

<p>Actually, this is pretty similar to how authentication often works in
real web applications:</p>

<p>Applications do not store your actual password in plain text (hopefully!) That
way if, for some reason, they get hacked, attackers wouldn&rsquo;t have your actual
password. Instead they store an encrypted version of the password.</p>

<p>Anyhow, we now want to add a method <code>encrypted_password</code> to the <code>Person</code> class,
which should return an <em>encrypted version</em> of the password that is stored in
the instance variable <code>@password</code>.</p>

<p>Encryption is one of the things in programming that require very deep expert
knowledge, and it is one of the things we definitely wouldn&rsquo;t want to implement
ourselves.</p>

<p>So far, all the Ruby features and methods that we have used are available right
away when the Ruby runtime <code>ruby</code> executes your code. However, Ruby also comes
with a ton of functionality that is not available (loaded) right away. Instead
it is stored in so called libraries (which are just Ruby files, too), and we
have to load them manually, in order to make them available.</p>

<p>To do this, we use the method <code>require</code>, and pass it the name of the library:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'digest'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Normally <code>require</code> statements should be placed at the very top of the file, so
it is easy to see what libraries a particular piece of code (class) uses.</p>

<p>We are going to omit the <code>initialize</code> and <code>name</code> methods here, indicate the
omission with the comment <code># ...</code>, and just keep the <code>password=</code> attribute
writer. In order to run this code make sure you keep all the methods.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'digest'</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">password</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">encrypted_password</span>
    <span class="no">Digest</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">SHA2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">hexdigest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vi">@password</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The library <code>digest</code> that we required includes a something called
<code>Digest::SHA2</code>.</p>

<p>In programming a &ldquo;digest&rdquo; is an algorithm to convert one string into another
in a way that the original string cannot be recovered later. However
digesting the same string will always result in the same other, unique string.
There are a good bunch of algorithms that do this, and &ldquo;sha2&rdquo; is the name of
one of them.</p>

<p>Ok. For our example here we only need to understand that, once we have
required the library <code>digest</code>, we can use the method <code>Digest::SHA2.hexdigest</code>,
and it will encrypt (&ldquo;digest&rdquo;) the string that we pass to it.</p>

<p>If now run the following code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ada"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"super secret"</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">encrypted_password</span>
</code></pre>

<p>it will output</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>eabd522910ccdd77aef079feff0c7bb6486f6ab207ae6d3ed9e671208c92ab0f
</code></pre>

<p>which is the digested form of the string <code>&quot;super secret&quot;</code>. Every time you run
the program you will see the same, unique string.</p>

  <h1>Modules</h1>

<p>It now makes sense to introduce another language feature in Ruby: modules.</p>

<p>In Ruby, modules are somewhat similar to classes: they are things that hold
methods, just like classes do. However, modules can not be instantiated. I.e.,
it is not possible to create objects from a module. And modules, unlike classes,
therefore do not have a method <code>new</code>.</p>

<p>So, what are modules useful for?</p>

<p>With modules you can share methods between classes: Modules can be included
into classes, and this makes their methods available on the class, just as if
we&rsquo;d copied and pasted these methods over to the class definition.</p>

<p>This is useful if we have methods that we want to reuse in certain classes, but
also want to keep them in a central place, so we do not have to repeat them
everywhere.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at this pretty contrived code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Cream</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">cream?</span>
    <span class="kp">true</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Cookie</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Cream</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">cookie</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Cookie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">cookie</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">cream?</span>
</code></pre>

<p>We still haven&rsquo;t been able to come up with a better minimal example of a module
and class that makes more sense than this. And we fully admit that this code
is rather weird. However, it&rsquo;s good enough to quickly explain how modules work :)</p>

<p>If you run this code it will output <code>true</code>. Why is that?</p>

<p>The method <code>cream?</code> is defined on the module <code>Cream</code>, and all it does is always
return the value <code>true</code>. Now, this module is included into the class <code>Cookie</code>.
So, if we now instantiate a cookie, we can call the method <code>cream?</code> on it,
and it will return the value <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Cool. Let&rsquo;s move on and use this for our <code>Person</code> class, which will hopefully
then make more sense.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that our application has other classes that need to encrypt things.
And we want to keep the exact way of <em>how</em> we encrypt things, the <em>implementation</em>
in one single place.</p>

<p>Why would we want to do that?</p>

<ul>
<li>One reason could be that when we want to switch to a different way of
encrypting things (maybe use a stronger encryption algorithm), we would then
only need to change it in this one place, in our module, and be done with it.</li>
<li>Another reason could be that we want the encryption algorithm to be somehow
configurable, for example in a configuration file that our application reads.
This would then require additional logic that we would not want to duplicate
across all the places where we need to encrypt something: we&rsquo;d want all this
to be kept in a central place.</li>
<li>Another, much simpler, but sometimes also valid reason could be that we
simply want to move some clutter out of sight, and hide it away in another
file: so we can focus on what our <code>Person</code> class does, instead of having to
look at the nitty-gritty details of how exactly we encrypt things.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyhow. Here&rsquo;s how we can create a meaningful module for our application,
and then use it in the class <code>Person</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'digest'</span>

<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Encryption</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">encrypt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="no">Digest</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">SHA2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">hexdigest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Encryption</span>

  <span class="c1"># ...</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">encrypted_password</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If you run this code, it will print out the same, encrypted version of the
password: cool, that&rsquo;s what we want.</p>

<p>We have moved the noisy details of the encryption algorithm to a module, and
then included the module to the class <code>Person</code>. This, at the very least, makes
the method <code>encrypted_password</code> much easier to read. Doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>We refer to the process of moving some logic (code) from one method to another
new method as &ldquo;extracting a method&rdquo;. In our case we have extracted the method
<code>encrypt</code> from the method <code>encrypt_password</code>. When we do this, methods usually become
shorter and more readable.</p>

  <h1>Private methods</h1>

<p>Remember how we said that instance variables store data that is &ldquo;private&rdquo; to
the object? Instance variables are only made accessible to the outside world
(we say &ldquo;it is exposed&rdquo;) if we add attribute accessors to the class.</p>

<p>In the same way classes sometimes want to keep certain methods private: methods
that aren&rsquo;t supposed to be called from outside of the object. Only the object
itself is supposed to use them internally, from other methods.</p>

<p>Imagine I am an instance of a class <code>ItalianRestaurant</code>, and I have a method
<code>pizza</code>, which is supposed to return an instance of the class <code>Pizza</code>.</p>

<p>When you approach me, and call the method <code>pizza</code> (i.e. ask me to bring a
pizza) then I&rsquo;ll know what to do, and how to do it. I&rsquo;ll get some prepared
pizza dough from somewhere, some tomato sauce, vegetables and other stuff from
somewhere else, prepare the pizza, bake it, put it on a nice plate, and finally
give (return) it to you.</p>

<p>However, you don&rsquo;t really care about any of these details. You are hungry, and
just want the pizza. All the exact steps involved are something that I keep
private to me, and maybe they&rsquo;ve been our family&rsquo;s best kept secret for
generations.</p>

<p>This is pretty much how objects work, too. The Italian restaurant object
exposes some stuff to the outer world (you), and keeps other things private.
They&rsquo;ll let you order a pizza, and other things. But they won&rsquo;t tell you the
exact ingredients of their tomato sauce, or how they manage to make this damn
great pizza dough.</p>

<p>In our <code>Person</code> example it makes sense to make the method <code>encrypt</code> private.</p>

<p>Currently, if you run the following code it will execute just fine, even though
it makes little sense:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ada"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">encrypt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"some other secret"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Why would a person encrypt some arbitrary string for someone else, and return
it? This is something that the person object should keep private. The
restaurant wouldn&rsquo;t turn flour, water, olive oil and other ingredients into
pizza dough for everyone else either.</p>

<p>We can make the method <code>encrypt</code> private like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Encryption</span>
  <span class="kp">private</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">encrypt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="no">Digest</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">SHA2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">hexdigest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The keyword <code>private</code> tells Ruby that all methods defined from now on, are
supposed to be private. They can be called from within the object (from other
methods that the class defines), but not from outside.</p>

<p>If you now try to call the method it will raise an error:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">person</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ada"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">encrypt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"super secret"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will print the error message:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>private method `encrypt' called for #&lt;Person:0x007fa179863770 @name="Ada"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Nice. Does this make sense?</p>

  <h1>Regular Expressions</h1>

<p><em>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;ll use regular
expressions.&rdquo;<br> Now they have two problems.</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty famous joke, and it refers to the fact that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a>
can be quite a pain to figure out.</p>

<p>However, once you know some basics about them, they&rsquo;re also extremely powerful,
and you can do amazing things with them, not only in Ruby, but also, for
example, in your editor, and command line tools.</p>

<p>Regular expressions are sort of a swiss army knife for finding things in
strings (text), extracting parts of them, or mass replacing certain bits with
something else.</p>

<p>E.g. you could do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extract area codes from phone numbers.</li>
<li>Validate the format of an email address.</li>
<li>For a list of files <code>a-01.mpeg</code>, <code>b-02.mpeg</code>, <code>c-03.mpeg</code>, change their
names to <code>01-a.mpeg</code>, <code>02-b.mpeg</code>, <code>03-c.mpeg</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regular expressions are a language to describe patterns of text. Wikipedia
says: <em>a sequence of characters that define a search pattern</em>.</p>

<p>For example the pattern <code>[0-9]+!</code> means: There needs to be at least one digit,
and it needs to be followed by an exclamation mark. The pattern
<code>([\w]+)-([\d]+)\.mpeg</code></p>

<p>Does this stuff look scary and cryptic? You bet. That&rsquo;s why regular expressions
have kind of a strange reputation in programming. They&rsquo;re super powerful, but
they&rsquo;re also kind of a pain: Like black magic, this power comes at a price.</p>

<p>The main reason why the language that is defined as regular expressions is so
hard to read is that it dates back <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#History">as far as 1956</a>,
and their first implementations in programming came up in the late 1960s. Back
then every single character of your code was kinda worth its weight in gold.
Memory was extremely limited, and code had to be as terse as possible.</p>

<p>Now, the most commonly used features of this language are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>String literals: find a particular piece of text</li>
<li>Anchors: the beginning and the end of the string, or a word</li>
<li>Character classes: define a set of allowed characters</li>
<li>Quantifiers: define how often a character is expected to occur</li>
<li>Captures: once found, capture a particular part of the text, so we can use it</li>
</ul>

<h2>String literals</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through some examples, to make this more practical. Let&rsquo;s say we
have the following text:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern."</span>
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; and we are interested to know if it contains the words <code>character</code> and
<code>sentence</code>. In Ruby, we could use a regular expression like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">matches</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/character/</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">matches</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will return an instance of the class <code>MatchData</code>. Whereas, when we look
for <code>sentence</code> we&rsquo;ll get <code>nil</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">matches</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/sentence/</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">matches</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note how in Ruby one can define a regular expression by enclosing it with
slashes <code>/</code>. There are other ways to define regular expressions, too, but
this is the most common one.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s kinda boring, right? We could just use the method <code>include?</code> for
strings, which lets us figure out the same thing. Let&rsquo;s spice this up a little.</p>

<h2>Anchors (boundaries)</h2>

<p>The most commonly used <em>anchors</em> are: Beginning or end of the string, beginning
or end of a line, beginning or end of a word.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern."</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">'Found "A" at the beginning of the string.'</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/^A/</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">'Found "O" at the beginning of the string.'</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/^O/</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">'Found the string "character".'</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/character/</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">'Found the word "character".'</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/character\b/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will output:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Found "A" at the beginning of the string.
Found the string "character".
</code></pre>

<p>So it finds the string &ldquo;character&rdquo;, but not the word &ldquo;character&rdquo;. This is
because the regular expression <code>/character\b/</code> requires a <em>word boundary</em> to be
found after the <em>string literal</em> (i.e. the literal piece of text) &ldquo;character&rdquo;.
Since in our example the text &ldquo;character&rdquo; is followed by another &ldquo;s&rdquo;, the
regular expression won&rsquo;t match.</p>

<h2>Character classes</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we want to find all the words that start with a vowel. For that
we can use a <em>character class</em>, i.e. a set of allowed characters. Again,
we use the anchor <em>word boundary</em> <code>\b</code>, this time to express that the vowel
needs to be at the beginning of the word.</p>

<p>While the method <code>match</code> returns an object (i.e. something &ldquo;truthy&rdquo;) when the
pattern matches (and <code>nil</code> when it doesn&rsquo;t), the method <code>scan</code> returns an array
with all the occurances of text that match the pattern.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s use it:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern."</span>

<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\b[aeiou][a-z]*\b/</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre>

<p>This will output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"expression"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"is"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"of"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Our regular expression defines that we&rsquo;re looking for a piece of text that</p>

<ul>
<li>starts with a word boundary,</li>
<li>followed by a character that is either &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;e&rdquo;, &ldquo;i&rdquo;, &ldquo;o&rdquo;, or &ldquo;u&rdquo;,</li>
<li>and potentially (<code>*</code>) followed by any character between &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;z&rdquo;, and</li>
<li>finally ends with a word boundary.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;ll explain the star <code>*</code> quantifier in a bit.</p>

<p>Notice something though?</p>

<p>Regular expressions are case sensitive. I.e. our piece of code did not match
the word &ldquo;A&rdquo; in the beginning of the string. In order to fix that we need
to allow uppercase letters as well:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\b[AEIOUaeiou][a-z]*\b/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Our output will include the capital &ldquo;A&rdquo; at the beginning of the string as well:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"A"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"expression"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"is"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"of"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This example also demostrates the difference between a <em>word boundary</em> and
<em>whitespace</em>.  A single space would count as whitespace, and we could use it to
match our words, too.  However, that would not work at the beginning and end of
a string. And it would not work when our word is followed by punctuation, such
as a comma or fullstop. The word boundary <code>\b</code> allows all of these, too.</p>

<p>So, what about the star <code>*</code> in the expression above?</p>

<h2>Quantifiers</h2>

<p>This is a quantifier. It means &ldquo;allow the stuff defined before zero, or any
number of times&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In our case it means that we&rsquo;re looking for a single vowel, followed by either
nothing, or one or many characters between &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;z&rdquo;. This means we match
both the words &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;a&rdquo; (not followed by anything before the word boundary),
as well as the words &ldquo;is&rdquo;, &ldquo;of&rdquo;, and &ldquo;expression&rdquo; (which are followed by one or
many characters).</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we want to omit single character words, but we do want to allow all
words longer than one character. For that we could change the &ldquo;none, one, or
many&rdquo; quantifier <code>*</code> to another quantifier <code>+</code> meaning &ldquo;at least one, or many&rdquo;:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\b[AEIOUaeiou][a-z]+\b/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This won&rsquo;t match the words &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;a&rdquo;, and instead output the following:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"expression"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"is"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"of"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>What if we are looking for words that start with a vowel, and are no more than
2 characters long? We could use the quantifier <code>?</code> which means &ldquo;none, or
exactly one&rdquo;:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\b[AEIOUaeiou][a-z]?\b/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"A"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"is"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"of"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If we remove the quantifier entirely, then the regular expression will look for
a word that starts with a vowel, followed by exactly one character:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\b[AEIOUaeiou][a-z]\b/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"is"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"of"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Captures</h2>

<p>Using the method <code>scan</code> with regular expressions like this is quite useful in
many situations. But sometimes, we need something more powerful.</p>

<p>Imagine we need to find all words that are followed by a word that starts with
a vowel.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try using <code>scan</code> for that:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\b[A-Za-z]+\b +\b[AEIOUaeiou][a-z]*\b/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The second part of this regular expression is just the same as above: Any word
that starts with a vowel, and that is one or many characters long.</p>

<p>Can you figure out the first part?</p>

<p>It also says: Match something that starts at a word boundary, then has one or
many characters between &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;Z&rdquo; or &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;z&rdquo; (that bit is new: you can
combine ranges as character classes), and that is followed by at least one
space.</p>

<p>If you run this you&rsquo;ll get the following output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"regular expression"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"is a"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"sequence of"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"define a"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Looks alright, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>However, we were only interested in words that are immediately followed by a
word starting with a vowel. Our strings contain two words.</p>

<p>So either we&rsquo;d have to work on these strings more (e.g. use <code>split</code> to split
off the second word). Or there&rsquo;s a smarter way of doing the same.</p>

<p>Enter captures.</p>

<p>In regular expressions one can &ldquo;mark&rdquo; certain parts of a patterns, saying:
&ldquo;Give me the bits that match this stuff here&rdquo;. In order to mark a part of
the pattern to be <em>captured</em> you&rsquo;d enclose it with parenthese, like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="sr">/\b([A-Za-z]+)\b +\b[AEIOUaeiou][a-z]*\b/</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note how we&rsquo;ve enclosed the first part of the pattern with parentheses.
This means &ldquo;match the full pattern, but only capture the parts that
we&rsquo;ve marked as interesting&rdquo;.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\b([A-Za-z]+)\b +\b[AEIOUaeiou][a-z]*\b/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This returns a nested array like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[[</span><span class="s2">"regular"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"is"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"sequence"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"define"</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Awesome! We get all the words that we were interested in.</p>

<p>But why is this a nested array? The method <code>scan</code> looks for each bit of text
that matches the given pattern (regular expression). It then extracts all the
&ldquo;marked&rdquo; (captured) parts from it, and keeps these as an array. As there can be
many occurances that match the pattern, and each of them can have many
captures, we get back a nested array.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s capture the second word (starting with a vowel) as well to demonstrate
this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\b([A-Za-z]+)\b +\b([AEIOUaeiou][a-z]*)\b/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will return:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[[</span><span class="s2">"regular"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"expression"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"is"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"sequence"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"of"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"define"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>More on character classes</h2>

<p>So far we have used character classes like <code>[aeiou]</code> (listing all allowed
characters literally), and <code>[a-z]</code> (specifying a range of characters).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to these.</p>

<p>One can negate classes by prepending a &ldquo;not&rdquo; character <code>^</code> inside the square
brackets. E.g. <code>[^AEIOUaeiou]</code> allows every character that is not a vowel.
So we can find all words that do <em>not</em> start with a vowel like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\b[^AEIOUaeiou ][^ ]*\b/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This means: Start at a word boundary, and allow everything that is not a vowel
or a space as a first character, when it is optionally followed by one or many
characters that are not a space, followed by a word boundary.</p>

<p>This will output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"regular"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"sequence"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"characters"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"that"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"define"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"search"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"pattern"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Also, regular expressions come with &ldquo;baked-in&rdquo;, predefined classes. For example
<code>\d</code> means &ldquo;any digit&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s a list of common classes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>\d</code> is the same as <code>[0-9]</code> (any digit)</li>
<li><code>\D</code> is the same as <code>[^0-9]</code> (everything except digits)</li>
<li><code>\w</code> is the same as <code>[A-Za-z_\-]</code>, called <em>word character</em> (i.e. this
allows all lowercase and uppercase latin letters, as well as underscores and
dashes)</li>
<li><code>\W</code> is the same as <code>[^A-Za-z_\-]</code> (everything that is not a word character)</li>
<li><code>\s</code> means &ldquo;any whitespace&rdquo;, including spaces, tabs, and linebreaks</li>
<li><code>\S</code> everything that is not whitespace</li>
</ul>

<p>That means we could refine our expression from above:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="sr">/\b[A-Za-z]+\b +\b[AEIOUaeiou][a-z]*\b/</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="sr">/\b\w+\b +\b[AEIOUaeiou]\w*\b/</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This might yield slightly different results if we have words that contained
dashes or underscores, but it is same in our case:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"regular expression"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"is a"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"sequence of"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"define a"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>One can also combine these predefined classes with each other, and literal
charachters. For example <code>[\w!?]+</code> would find a sequence of at one or many
characters that is a word character, an exclamation or a question mark.</p>

<h2>Anything</h2>

<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s one special character that matches anything: the dot <code>.</code>.</p>

<p>I.e. the regular expression <code>.*</code> matches &ldquo;any character, zero, or any number of
times&rdquo;. This may be useful if you are looking, for example, for whatever text
is enclosed in parentheses:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Regular expressions are powerful (and sometimes confusing, even to experienced developers)."</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\(.*\)/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the backslashes before the opening and closing parentheses? We want to
match these literal characters, and not use them with their special meaning of
capturing their content here. Therefore we need to escape them to tell Ruby:
Yep, we really mean a parenthesis here.</p>

<p>By the way this will output the following:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"(and sometimes confusing, even to experienced developers)"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Whoops. Maybe we actually also do want to capture a part or this, and omit the
actual parentheses from the result. We can do that by placing an extra pair
of un-escaped (capturing) parentheses inside the escaped (literal) ones:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/\((.*)\)/</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And now we&rsquo;ll get this result, which has the parentheses stripped off:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[[</span><span class="s2">"and sometimes confusing, even to experienced developers"</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Rubular</h2>

<p>Confused? Don&rsquo;t worry. We all are.</p>

<p>Try to remember some of the most basic, simple stuff. Then try using it, maybe
in your text editor, when you search for a certain phrase. Over time you&rsquo;ll remember
a few more things, bit by bit, and things will become a little less confusing.
Writing a long, complicated regular expression, that actually works, without
thinking, trying, and re-trying a lot is something that only few developers
actually can do - and the author of this book isn&rsquo;t one of them.</p>

<p>If you cannot figure out a certain regular expression, or if you want to
experiment with something then <a href="http://rubular.com">Rubular</a> is a great tool
for that. Enter some text to the &ldquo;test string&rdquo; text area, and then start
writing a regular expression, one bit after another. The app will display the
parts that match, and your captures if you define some.</p>

  <h1>Exercises (old)</h1>

<p>These exercises are an outdated set of exercises that need to be ported and
adjusted in order to reflect the current order of topics in our book.</p>

<p>Many of them  at the moment assume things early on that only are explained
later in the book.</p>

  <h1>Working with Numbers</h1>

<p>In order to start <code>irb</code> open your terminal and type <code>irb</code>, then hit the
<code>return</code> key (<code>enter</code>). In order to quit <code>irb</code> again (and get back to your
system shell prompt) you can type <code>exit</code> or press <code>ctrl-d</code>, which does the
same.</p>

<h2>Exercise 1.1</h2>

<p>In <code>irb</code>, calculate:</p>

<ul>
<li>How many hours are in a year.</li>
<li>How many minutes are in a decade?</li>
<li>How many seconds old are you?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercise 1.2</h2>

<p>What do you think happens when you combine the following floats and integers?</p>

<p>Try computing these in <code>irb</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>3.0 / 2</code></li>
<li><code>3 / 2.0</code></li>
<li><code>4 ** 2.0</code></li>
<li><code>4.1 % 2</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Is the result a float or an integer?</p>

<h2>Exercise 1.3</h2>

<p>Methods are a way of &ldquo;doing something with an object&rdquo;. E.g. in Ruby, numbers
have two methods that allow you to check whether the number is odd or even.</p>

<p>Look through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Fixnum.html">documentation for integer</a>
numbers (called <code>Fixnum</code>) and find the methods that tell if a number is odd or
even.</p>

<h2>Exercise 1.4</h2>

<p>In <code>irb</code>, use these methods to find out if certain numbers are odd or even.
Numbers like <code>0, 1, 2, 99, -502</code> etc.</p>

<p class="hint">
You can use a method by appending a dot <code>.</code> and then the method name
to the object. E.g. <code>-99.abs</code> uses (we also say: &ldquo;calls&rdquo;) the method
<code>abs</code> on the number <code>-99</code>.
</p>

<p>Try for yourself what it does, and google for &ldquo;ruby abs&rdquo; to find
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Numeric.html#method-i-abs">the documentation</a>
for this method.</p>

  <h1>Working with Strings</h1>

<p>In order to start <code>irb</code> open your terminal and type <code>irb</code>, then hit the
<code>return</code> key (<code>enter</code>). In order to quit <code>irb</code> again (and get back to your
system shell prompt) you can type <code>exit</code> or press <code>ctrl-d</code>, which does the
same.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2.1</h2>

<p>What do you think this will do?</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"world"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Try it yourself.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2.3</h2>

<p>Skim through the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/String.html">documentation for strings</a>
in the Ruby documentation, and look for a method that prepends one string
to another string.</p>

<p>Using that method prepend the string <code>&quot;Learning &quot;</code> to the string <code>&quot;Ruby&quot;</code></p>

<p><a href="/solutions/strings-3.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 2.4</h2>

<p>Skim through the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/String.html">documentation for strings</a>
in the Ruby documentation, and look for a method that removes characters
from a string.</p>

<p>Using that method turn the string <code>&quot;Learning Ruby&quot;</code> into the string <code>&quot;Lrnng Rb&quot;</code>.</p>

<p><a href="/solutions/strings-4.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 2.5</h2>

<p>Find out how to convert the string <code>&quot;1.23&quot;</code> into the number <code>1.23</code>.</p>

<p>You can either, again, skim the documentation page for strings, or google for
&ldquo;ruby convert string to number&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Then also find out what method can be used to turn the string <code>&quot;1&quot;</code> into the
number <code>1</code> (remember floats and integers are different kinds of numbers).</p>

<p>Confirm that you have found the right methods by trying them in <code>irb</code>.</p>

<p><a href="/solutions/strings-5.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 2.6</h2>

<p>There is a method that allows to justify a string, and padding it with another
string.</p>

<p>Find that method and use it on the string <code>&quot;Ruby&quot;</code> together with <code>&quot;&lt;3&quot;</code> so that
you get the following string back:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="s2">"Ruby&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;ll admit that this is a rather creative usage of this method. Normally you&rsquo;d
use it to align strings to columns (e.g. so that they line up nicely when you
format a table). You&rsquo;ll use this method in other exercises later on.</p>

  <h1>Working with Arrays (1)</h1>

<p>Before you get started, make sure you have your text editor and terminal open,
and you have navigated to your exercises directory in the terminal. E.g. <code>cd
~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises</code>.</p>

<h2>Exercise 3.1</h2>

<p>Create a new, empty file. Save it as <code>arrays_1-1.rb</code>. Fill in the following
line:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="c1"># your code goes here</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So that, when you run your code (run <code>ruby arrays_1-1.rb</code>), you get the
following output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="mi">5</span>
</code></pre>

<p><a href="/solutions/arrays_1-1.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 3.2</h2>

<p>Copy your file to a new file: <code>cp arrays_1-1.rb arrays_1-2.rb</code>, then open this
new file.</p>

<p>Add another line <em>before the line that you just added</em>, so that, when you run

<p>So that you get the following output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">]</span>

<p class="hint">
Read the documentation for the method <code>select</code> that you can use on arrays

<h2>Exercise 3.4</h2>

<p>Again, copy your last file to a new file: <code>cp arrays_1-3.rb arrays_1-4.rb</code>,
then open this new file.</p>

<p>Now change the code that you just added so that you get the following output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p class="hint">
The method <code>select</code> that you used in the last exercise returns an array.
On this array (the return value) you can use another method, by, again, just
appending a dot <code>.</code> and the method name to it, i.e., to the end of the line.
</p>

<p class="hint">
There is another method that reverses the order of the array. You can
find it by googling for &ldquo;ruby array reverse&rdquo;.

  <h1>Working with Nested Arrays</h1>

<p>Note: At the moment these exercises require reading up until &ldquo;Block return values&rdquo;.
You should know how to use the method <code>collect</code> on arrays.</p>

<p>Before you get started, make sure you have your text editor and terminal open, and
you have navigated to your exercises directory in the terminal. E.g. <code>cd
~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises</code>.</p>

  <h1>Truthiness</h1>

<h2>Exercise 9.1</h2>

<p>Make a new file <code>truthiness-1.rb</code>, and add the following lines:</p>

<p>This exercise is about validating what we&rsquo;ve learned about truthiness.</p>

<p>You have the following array:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">objects</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kp">false</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">""</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[],</span> <span class="no">Object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Class</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Add some code that outputs the following table. The last column should be
filled in with by either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending what the operation
<code>!!object</code><code>, which is the same as</code>not not object` for each of the objects
returns:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>object                     | !!object
true                       | [true|false]
false                      | [true|false]
nil                        | [true|false]
0                          | [true|false]
1                          | [true|false]
""                         | [true|false]
[]                         | [true|false]
#&lt;Object:0x007fb3dc0ea1b8&gt; | [true|false]
#&lt;Class:0x007fb3dc0e2cd8&gt;  | [true|false]
#&lt;Module:0x007fb3dc0d9ea8&gt; | [true|false]
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the method <code>inspect</code> in order to, for each of the values, get a
representation that looks like the code.</p>

<p>Of course you will get different object ids for the object, class, and module
instances everytime you run your code.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s prettify this table by removing the object ids. You can do this
calling <code>sub(/:.*&gt;/, &quot;&gt;&quot;)</code> on whatever <code>inspect</code> returns.</p>

<p>Your table should now look like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>object    | !!object
true      | true
false     | false
nil       | false
0         | true
1         | true
""        | true
[]        | true
#&lt;Object&gt; | true
#&lt;Class&gt;  | true
#&lt;Module&gt; | true
</code></pre>

<h2>Bonus: Exercise 9.2</h2>

<p>Copy your file to a new file <code>truthiness-2.rb</code>, and change your code so that
it outputs the following table. Fill each cell with the result that <code>==</code>
returns for each combination.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>          | true      | false      | 0          | 1          | ""         | []         | #&lt;Object&gt; | #&lt;Class&gt;  | #&lt;Module&gt;

  <h1>The Email Class</h1>

<h2>Exercise 10.1</h2>

<p>In a new file <code>email_1.rb</code> write a class <code>Email</code> that has a <code>subject</code>,
<code>date</code>, and <code>from</code> attribute. Make it so that these attributes can be populated
through <code>new</code> and <code>initialize</code>.</p>

<p>The following code</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Email</span>
  <span class="c1"># fill in this class body</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Date:    </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">date</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>

<p>should then output the following:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Date:    2014-12-01
From:    Ferdous
Subject: Homework this week
</code></pre>

<p><a href="/solutions/email-1.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 10.2</h2>

<p>Once you have this class, copy your file to <code>email_2.rb</code>.</p>

<p>Change your class so that the <code>initialize</code> method now takes a <code>subject</code> string,
and a <code>headers</code> hash. This is then more in line with how actual emails are
stored in the real world: the values <code>date</code> and <code>from</code> are stored on a hash,
which is called the &ldquo;email headers&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Doing so, in the code above the only line you should change is the one that
instantiates the email object, which should now read:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Keep on coding! :)"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:date</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"2014-12-01"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Ferdous"</span> <span class="p">})</span>

<p>Your goal is to complete the code in a way so it outputs the following:</p>

<p>You are allowed to add as many methods to the classes <code>Email</code>, <code>Mailbox</code> and
<code>MailboxTextFormatter</code> as you deem useful. In your final solution you are not
allowed to change any of the code outside (after) the class definitions. For
debugging purposes, you can, of course, change all the code you want :)</p>

<p>If you do this exercise in one of our study groups then best do it together
with someone else. We found pairs to work best, and a three person team would
be better than doing it on your own.</p>

<p>Try to come up with a working solution first. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how elegant,
generic, or pretty it is. Whatever produces the required output is fine for a
first solution.</p>

<p>Then, later, look at your code, and try to improve it by cleaning up everything
that you don&rsquo;t like, or deam ugly.</p>

<p>Eventually, one goal to aim for would be: Adding another column to the table
only requires mimimal changes, e.g. changes to one or two places in your
formatter class.</p>

  <h1>The Mailbox Html Formatter</h1>

<h2>Separation of concerns</h2>

<p>One question that may have come up while working on the mailbox text formatter
exercise is:</p>

<p>Why would we have a separate class for formatting the ASCII table (that is, a
plain text table that uses characters like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, and <code>|</code>)?</p>

<p>The reason is: We want each one of our classes to encapsulate one concept that
is useful in our application. We also say: each one of our classes should be
<em>concerned</em> with one responsibility.</p>

<p>An email vaguely resembles the concept of an analog letter, written on paper:
some message is being sent from one person to another. Nowadays everyone knows
what an email is: it stores all information about this particular message. The
same is true for mailboxes, which are used to store a bunch of emails.
Formatting a number of emails in order to be displayed on a text based terminal
is a very different concept, and concern.</p>

<p>Therefore it makes a lot of sense to have three different classes implement each
one of these concepts, or concerns. And it even makes <em>so</em> much sense that it is
called a design principle in programming: The principle of <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Separation_of_concerns">separation of
concerns</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from being comprehensible and mapping to concepts that we already know,
one other advantage is: We can now easily implement other formatter classes
that format our emails in a different way, suitable to be displayed in other
media.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s what this exercise is about: We want to display our mailbox contents
in HTML, the format that browsers like to use. If you are unfamiliar with what
HTML is, and how it looks like, you can read up on it
<a href="http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/html.html">here</a>.
This will be our first step towards learning how to build a web application.</p>

<h2>Model, View, Controller</h2>

<p>Before we get to that, we&rsquo;d like to point out one other aspect, that you&rsquo;ll
remember when we get to talk about the architecture that Rails use to structure
and separate concerns, called &ldquo;model, view, controller&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>The two classes <code>Email</code> and <code>Mailbox</code> in your application are <em>models</em>: they
are concerned with modelling those &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; things that your users are
interested in: they want to work with emails.</li>
<li>The class <code>MailboxTextFormatter</code> on the other hand is a <em>view</em>: It is used in
order to generate a certain representation, in a format that is suitable to a
certain medium (the terminal, in our case).</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have a <em>controller</em> class so far, but the little bit of code at the
end of the file does what a controller usually would do: it generates some
models (the emails, and the mailbox objects) and passes them to the view (the
formatter) in order to be rendered into something that can then be returned
and displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t make a whole lot of sense to you at the moment, don&rsquo;t worry.
You&rsquo;ll understand it more once we build our first Rails application.</p>

<h2>Exercise 13.1</h2>

<p>Ok, now to our exercise. We will  start over with the same code again, except
that our formatter class now will be called <code>MailboxHtmlFormatter</code>.</p>

<p>Copy your file <code>mailbox_text-1.rb</code> to <code>mailbox_html-1.rb</code> and change it
like so. Then fill in the <code>MailboxHtmlFormatter</code> class.</p>

<p>Does that look scary? A little bit, maybe. It&rsquo;s probably fair
to say that manually writing HTML isn&rsquo;t very popular amongst most programmers.
Therefore there are quite a few tools that make our lives easier. And your task
is to write such a tool.</p>

<p>Also, this exercise should actually be easier for you to complete than the
previous one. You already have a bunch of practice in iterating over emails,
and working with arrays and strings. And this time, you don&rsquo;t need to deal with
the maximum length of strings per column. You can just interpolate things
together.</p>

  <h1>Storing our HTML to a File</h1>

<h2>Exercise 14.1</h2>

<p>In this exercise our goal is to store the generated HTML for our mailbox to a
file, so that we can finally view it in an actual browser.</p>

<p>Your objective is to write a file (using Ruby) that contains all the HTML
from the last exercise.</p>

<p>Building on the last exercise, copy your file to a new file <code>cp mailbox_html-1.rb
mailbox_file-1.rb</code>  and change the last line:</p>

<p>Instead of passing the HTML to <code>puts</code> you should be passing it to a different
method, so that running your program writes the HTML file that we are after.
In order to find that method try googling for &ldquo;ruby write file&rdquo;. Call this
file <code>emails.html</code>.</p>

<p>When you open this file in a text editor you should see the same HTML from
the last exercise. When you open it in your browser it should look like this:</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2208/5602614/5ac2058c-935a-11e4-9c01-7ff9ec3b66cb.png" /></p>

  <h1>Reading from a CSV File</h1>

<p>So far our program has all the email data <em>hardcoded</em>: All the data is baked
right into our code. Everytime you run it, it will display all the same emails.
Obviously that&rsquo;s not a very useful for a real world program.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s change this to read our data from an external data source instead.</p>

<p>One very simple and pretty popular way to store data to files is using the
format CSV. This stands for &ldquo;comma separated values&rdquo; (although, often times
semicolons are used as a separator instead of commas), and it is something that
spreadsheets can read and export. Being able to work with CSV can be pretty
handy: just write a little Ruby script, and filter that data, or work with it
otherwise.</p>

<p>The first line in the code below <code>require &quot;csv&quot;</code> makes Ruby&rsquo;s CSV library
available to your program so that you can then use the class <code>CSV</code>.</p>

<h2>Exercise 15.1</h2>

<p>Building on the same code from the last exercises, your objective is to
read the email data from a file <code>emails.csv</code>. This file should be stored
in the same directory as your Ruby program, and contain the following data:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Date,From,Subject
2014-12-01,Ferdous,Homework this week
2014-12-01,Dajana,Keep on coding! :)
2014-12-02,Ariane,Re: Homework this week
2014-12-11,Maria,I'm back in Berlin
</code></pre>

<p>You can create that file by copying the four lines from above to your editor.</p>

<p>In order to complete this exercise you&rsquo;ll need to find out how to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the contents of a file to Ruby, as a string</li>
<li>Parse this string as CSV (google for &ldquo;ruby csv&rdquo; and/or look at the documentation)</li>
<li>For each of the rows, ignoring the header line, create an <code>Email</code> instance</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, you should replace the following lines of code:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">emails</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="no">Email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Homework this week"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Ferdous"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:date</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"2014-12-01"</span> <span class="p">}),</span>
  <span class="no">Email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Keep on coding! :)"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Dajana"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:date</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"2014-12-01"</span> <span class="p">}),</span>
  <span class="no">Email</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Re: Homework this week"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Ariane"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:date</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"2014-12-02"</span> <span class="p">})</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have figured out how to read and parse the CSV file, and create an
array of <code>Email</code> instances out of that data, your next task is to encapsulate
all of that into a class <code>EmailsCsvStore</code>. This class should take a filename,
and have a method <code>read</code>, which returns the emails array.</p>

<p>In the end that part of the code should read:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">"csv"</span>

<p>Whenever you sit down to do some of the exercises in this book make sure you
have your text editor and terminal open. In your terminal:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a new directory where you want to keep Ruby files for our exercises. For
example: <code>~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises</code>. In
order to create that directory in the terminal you can run: <code>mkdir

<li><p>Then navigate to this directory: <code>cd ~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises</code></p></li>
<li><p>In order to check if you are in the right directory you can always run:
<code>pwd</code>. (That&rsquo;s short for <em>print working directory</em>, meaning, it prints the name
of the current directory.)</p></li>

<p></p>

  <h1>Working with Numbers</h1>

<p>In order to do these exercises you should have read at least the chapter about
[built_in_classes/numbers.html].</p>

<h2>Exercise 1.1</h2>

<p>In <code>irb</code>, calcluate:</p>

<ul>
<li>How many hours are in a year.</li>
<li>How many minutes are in a decade?</li>
<li>How many seconds old are you?</li>
</ul>

<p class="hint">
To start <code>irb</code> open your terminal and type <code>irb</code>, then
hit the <code>return</code> key (<code>enter</code>). To quit it (and get back
to your system shell prompt) type <code>exit</code> or press <code>ctrl-d</code>.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 1.2</h2>

<p>What do you think happens when you combine floats and integers the following
in the following calculations?</p>

<p>Try computing these in <code>irb</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>3 / 2</code></li>
<li><code>3.0 / 2</code></li>
<li><code>3 / 2.0</code></li>
<li><code>4 * 2.0</code></li>
<li><code>0 + 1</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Is the result a float or an integer?</p>

<h2>Exercise 1.3</h2>

<p>Try finding out what &ldquo;modulo&rdquo; means by asking Google.</p>

<p>In Ruby (and many other languages) the operator for modulo is <code>%</code>.</p>

<p>Try the following in <code>irb</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>5 % 2</code></li>
<li><code>15 % 2</code></li>
<li><code>505 % 2</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>8 % 5</code></li>
<li><code>9 % 5</code></li>
<li><code>10 % 5</code></li>
<li><code>11 % 5</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercise 1.4</h2>

<p>Methods are a way of &ldquo;doing something with an object&rdquo;, and you&rsquo;ll learn a lot
more about them in a few chapters.</p>

<p>In Ruby, numbers have methods that allow you to check whether the number is odd
or even.</p>

<p>Look through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Integer.html">documentation for integer</a>
numbers and find the methods that tell if a number is odd or even.</p>

<p>Look at the examples for some of the other methods on that page.</p>

<p class="hint">
You can use a method by appending a dot <code>.</code> and then the method name
to the object. E.g. <code>-99.abs</code> uses (we also say: &ldquo;calls&rdquo;) the method
<code>abs</code> on the number <code>-99</code>.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 1.5</h2>

<p>In <code>irb</code>, use these methods to find out if certain numbers are odd or even.</p>

<p>Try a bunch of numbers like <code>0, 1, 2, 99, -502</code> etc.</p>

<p>Try for yourself what it does, and google for &ldquo;ruby number odd even&rdquo; to find
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Integer.html#method-i-odd-3F">the documentation</a>
for these methods.</p>

  <h1>Working with Strings</h1>

<p>In order to do these exercises you should have read at least the chapter about
[built_in_classes/strings.html].</p>

<h2>Exercise 2.1</h2>

<p>In <code>irb</code> try figuring out how to produce the following String: <code>&quot;Ruby&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Try using no more than two other String objects.</p>

<p><a href="/solutions_2/strings-1.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<p class="hint">
To start <code>irb</code> open your terminal and type <code>irb</code>, then
hit the <code>return</code> key (<code>enter</code>). To quit it (and get back
to your system shell prompt) type <code>exit</code> or press <code>ctrl-d</code>.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 2.2</h2>

<p>Look through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/String.html">documentation for Strings</a>.</p>

<p>Do you spot any interesting methods?</p>

<h2>Exercise 2.3</h2>

<p>What do you think this will do?</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">irb</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"world"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">length</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Try it yourself in <code>irb</code>.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2.4</h2>

<p>Look through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/String.html">documentation for Strings</a>,
and find out how to convert the string <code>&quot;1.23&quot;</code> into the number <code>1.23</code>.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t find it, google for &ldquo;ruby convert string to float&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Then also find out what method can be used to turn the string <code>&quot;1&quot;</code> into the
number <code>1</code> (remember floats and integers are different kinds of numbers).</p>

<p>Confirm that you have found the right methods by trying them in <code>irb</code>.</p>

  <h1>Working with Arrays (1)</h1>

<p>In order to do these exercises you should have read at least the chapter about
[built_in_classes/arrays.html].</p>

<p class="hint">
Make sure you have your text editor and terminal open, and you have navigated
to your exercises directory in the terminal. E.g. <code>cd ~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises</code>.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 3.1</h2>

<p>In the Array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>, what&rsquo;s the index of the number <code>4</code>?</p>

<p><a href="/solutions_2/arrays_1-1.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 3.2</h2>

<p>In <code>irb</code>, how can you ask the Array, and check if your previous answer was correct?</p>

<p><a href="/solutions_2/arrays_1-2.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 3.3</h2>

<p>In <code>irb</code>, how can you ask the Array for the number of elements it contains?</p>

<p><a href="/solutions_2/arrays_1-3.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 3.1</h2>

<p>Create a new, empty file. Save it as <code>arrays_1-1.rb</code>. Fill in the following
line:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="c1"># your code goes here</span>
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; so that, when you run your code (run <code>ruby arrays_1-1.rb</code>), you get the
following output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="mi">5</span>
</code></pre>

<p><a href="/solutions_2/arrays_1-4.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 3.2</h2>

<p>Copy your file to a new file: <code>cp arrays_1-1.rb arrays_1-2.rb</code>, then open this
new file.</p>

<p>Add another line <em>before the line that you just added</em>, so that, when you run
your code, you get the following output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="mi">99</span>
</code></pre>

<p><a href="/solutions_2/arrays_1-5.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 3.3</h2>

<p>Make a new file <code>arrays_1-3.rb</code>, and fill in the following line:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="c1"># your code goes here</span>
<span class="nb">p</span> <span class="n">numbers</span>
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; so that you get the following output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p class="hint">
You know how to get the individual numbers. And you know that you can list
things separated by comma, and enclosed with square brackets in order to get a
new Array. Try combining this, and &ldquo;listing&rdquo; the code that gets a number
from the array.
</p>

<p><a href="/solutions_2/arrays_1-6.html" class="solution">Show solution</a></p>

<h2>Exercise 3.4</h2>

<p>Again, copy your last file to a new file: <code>cp arrays_1-3.rb arrays_1-4.rb</code>,
then open this new file.</p>

<p>Now add <em>another</em> line after the one that you just added (i.e. before you
finally output the array using <code>p</code>).</p>

<p>Try to figure out how to transform your Array so you get the following output:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p class="hint">
Before you do anything else, try describing the problem in English. What
verb do you use to describe this transformation?
</p>

<p class="hint">
Look through the methods listed on the left side of the
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Array.html">documentation for Arrays</a>.
to see if any of these describes what you&rsquo;re looking for.
