# Programming workflow

In order to do programming excercises on your computer, play around with things
you learned, and write actual, useful programs you want to learn the following
workflow:

* Write some code in your text editor.
* Save the code to a file in a particular directory. The filename should end
  with `.rb`.
* Open your terminal.
* Navigate to that directory using `cd`.
* Execute the file using `ruby`.
* Switch back and forth between the text editor and terminal, so you
  can make small changes in your code, and then run it through `ruby` to see
  what it does.

In order to switch back and forth between apps quickly you can use the keyboard
shortcut `cmd-tab` on Mac OSX, and `alt-tab` on Ubuntu and Windows.

In your shell you can use the `cursor up` key to go through your last used
commands: you don't have to type `ruby hello.rb` again. Just hit `cursor up`
and then enter to run it again.
