# Working with Strings

In order to do these exercises you should have read at least the chapter about
[built_in_classes/strings.html].

## Exercise 2.1

In `irb` try figuring out how to produce the following String: `"Ruby<3<3<3"`.

Try using no more than two other String objects.

<p class="hint">
To start <code>irb</code> open your terminal and type <code>irb</code>, then
hit the <code>return</code> key (<code>enter</code>). To quit it (and get back
to your system shell prompt) type <code>exit</code> or press <code>ctrl-d</code>.
</p>

## Exercise 2.2

Look through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/String.html">documentation for Strings</a>.

Do you spot any interesting methods?

## Exercise 2.3

What do you think this will do?

```ruby
$ irb
> "hello".length + "world".length
```

Try it yourself in `irb`.

## Exercise 2.4

Look through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/String.html">documentation for Strings</a>,
and find out how to convert the string `"1.23"` into the number `1.23`.

If you can't find it, google for "ruby convert string to float".

Then also find out what method can be used to turn the string `"1"` into the
number `1` (remember floats and integers are different kinds of numbers).

Confirm that you have found the right methods by trying them in `irb`.
