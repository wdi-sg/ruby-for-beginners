# Exercises

If you haven't done the [try ruby](http://tryruby.org) course already, we
recommend you do at least a couple of lessons over there too.

Whenever you sit down to do some of the exercises in this book make sure you
have your text editor and terminal open. In your terminal:

* Create a new directory where you want to keep Ruby files for our exercises. For
  example: `~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises`. In
  order to create that directory in the terminal you can run: `mkdir
  ~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises`.

* Then navigate to this directory: `cd ~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises`

* In order to check if you are in the right directory you can always run:
  `pwd`. (That's short for *print working directory*, meaning, it prints the name
  of the current directory.)

* In order to see all the files and subdirectories contained in the current
  directory you can run `ls`.
