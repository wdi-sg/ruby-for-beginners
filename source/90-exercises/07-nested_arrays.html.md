# Working with Nested Arrays

Note: At the moment these exercises require reading up until "Block return values".
You should know how to use the method `collect` on arrays.

Before you get started, make sure you have your text editor and terminal open, and
you have navigated to your exercises directory in the terminal. E.g. `cd
~/ruby-for-beginners/exercises`.

## Exercise 7.1

Make a new file `nested_arrays-1.rb`, and fill in the following line:

```ruby
numbers = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
# your code goes here
p sums
```

So that you get the following output:

```ruby
[6, 15, 24]
```
