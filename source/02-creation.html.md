# Programming is creation

*Things coming to life*

Programming is creation. Whenever you run a program a little universe is
created. Things come to life and interact with each other, according to the
rules that you, as their creator, define.

Imagine you build an application like Twitter. Then, as a developer, in the
programming language of your choice, you would say things like "Let there be
users! And let there be tweets!", and once your application starts these things
will come into existence. Next you would go ahead and define "Users can create
tweets, and they can follow each other". And from now on, every time new users
are created in the little universe that is your application, these users will
have the ability to tweet and follow each other.
