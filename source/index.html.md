# Ruby For Beginners

*[Ruby Monday Study Group](http://rubymonstas.org) curriculum for beginners*

This book has been written after we have run 4 beginners groups at our [Ruby
Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org) groups in Berlin, and it outlines the current
state of our beginner groups curriculum.

After completing this curriculum you'll be able to read, understand, and write
basic Ruby code yourself:

You can use this knowledge to create small tools that might help you in your
day-to-day work (such as converting numbers, or extracting data from files)
that normally would cost a lot of manual work. You'll be able to jump into
other tutorials, and have a much easier time understanding what they're
talking about. And you can start working on our next curriculum which will
walk you through the basics of building an actual
[web application](http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org).

If you'd like to print this book, or export it as a PDF try using [this page](/print.html),
which is a single-page version of the entire book.
