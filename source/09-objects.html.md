# Objects, Classes, Methods

We've talked about objects quite a bit now, merely *using* that term as a
synomym for "things". You've learned to do stuff with simple objects such as
numbers and Strings, and the data structures Arrays and Hashes. You've also
learned what a method is, how to define and use them, and how to pass things to
them, and get others back.

We're also prepared well enough to have a closer look at objects, classes
(types of things) and methods, and how they relate to each other.

As a sidenote, you may have heard the following. Rubyist love saying it:

<p class="hint">
In Ruby everything is an object.
</p>

Actually, this is a little bit of a lie. Even though it's being said so often,
it isn't completely true: not *everything* is an object. There are a few things
that are not objects.

But almost everything is, and that's good enough to know for now.

<p class="hint">
In Ruby almost everything is an object :)
</p>

(Just in case you want to out-smart people at your local Ruby user group
though, remember to ask "Really? Is an [if](conditionals.html) statement an
object or a method?  How about [self](/writing_classes/self.html)?")
