# Reading error messages

*Your new best friends*

As programmers we want to build things that work. When we do exercises we want
to figure out the solution to the given problem. Seeing error messages therefore
has a negative connotation to it: we haven't managed to get it right! Right?

Well, yes. But also, no. Errors can also indicate progress. Often error
messages indicate that we've done the right first step, and now have to figure
out the right next step.

Whenever you find an error message printed on your terminal, don't fret.
Instead, appreciate it. Read it carefully. Ruby is trying to give you a hand
and help. Normally an error message tells you exactly what went wrong in your
code, and where. Once you've understood what has happened look at your code and
try to understand why it happened, and how you might fix it.

Often, when you fix one thing, you'll get a different error message.
That's progress. Rinse and repeat until your code does what you want.

For a beginner, Ruby error messages can sometimes be hard to read. There are
certain conventions used, e.g. for indicating there's an instance of
a certain class involved. Backtraces might be hard to read and might look
frightening. But all they do is tell you the exact path of execution Ruby
took until it ended up raising an error.

If you do not understand an error message and you have the opportunity to
ask someone else, then do so. You'll get better and better at reading
error messages over time. And you'll become friends with them.
