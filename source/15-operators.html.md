# Operators

We've already used some arithmetic operators (`+` and `*`) above. You have
also learned that operators, under the hood, are just methods. Ruby just
adds a little bit of syntax sugar on top of these methods, so they're sweeter
to read, and write.

There also are operators for comparing things, for logical calculations, and
other operations. Let talk about some more of them.
