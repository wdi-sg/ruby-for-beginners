# Private methods

Remember how we said that instance variables store data that is "private" to
the object? Instance variables are only made accessible to the outside world
(we say "it is exposed") if we add attribute accessors to the class.

In the same way classes sometimes want to keep certain methods private: methods
that aren't supposed to be called from outside of the object. Only the object
itself is supposed to use them internally, from other methods.

Imagine I am an instance of a class `ItalianRestaurant`, and I have a method
`pizza`, which is supposed to return an instance of the class `Pizza`.

When you approach me, and call the method `pizza` (i.e. ask me to bring a
pizza) then I'll know what to do, and how to do it. I'll get some prepared
pizza dough from somewhere, some tomato sauce, vegetables and other stuff from
somewhere else, prepare the pizza, bake it, put it on a nice plate, and finally
give (return) it to you.

However, you don't really care about any of these details. You are hungry, and
just want the pizza. All the exact steps involved are something that I keep
private to me, and maybe they've been our family's best kept secret for
generations.

This is pretty much how objects work, too. The Italian restaurant object
exposes some stuff to the outer world (you), and keeps other things private.
They'll let you order a pizza, and other things. But they won't tell you the
exact ingredients of their tomato sauce, or how they manage to make this damn
great pizza dough.

In our `Person` example it makes sense to make the method `encrypt` private.

Currently, if you run the following code it will execute just fine, even though
it makes little sense:

```ruby
person = Person.new("Ada")
p person.encrypt("some other secret")
```

Why would a person encrypt some arbitrary string for someone else, and return
it? This is something that the person object should keep private. The
restaurant wouldn't turn flour, water, olive oil and other ingredients into
pizza dough for everyone else either.

We can make the method `encrypt` private like so:

```ruby
module Encryption
  private

  def encrypt(string)
    Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(string)
  end
end
```

The keyword `private` tells Ruby that all methods defined from now on, are
supposed to be private. They can be called from within the object (from other
methods that the class defines), but not from outside.

If you now try to call the method it will raise an error:

```ruby
person = Person.new("Ada")
p person.encrypt("super secret")
```

This will print the error message:

```
private method `encrypt' called for #<Person:0x007fa179863770 @name="Ada">
```

Nice. Does this make sense?
