        <h1>Writing a new method</h1>

<p>As programmers we like to split up our tasks, and do one thing after another.
This allows us to focus on one small task, and once we&#39;ve solved it, we move on
to the next one.</p>

<p>When you need to add some new functionality to your program you&#39;ll often
find yourself thinking &quot;I should add a method for this&quot;: methods add behaviour.</p>

<p>Now, the first thing you should ask yourself is: &quot;What is it that this method
should do?&quot; The answer to this gives you a hint for a good method name.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you are working on an application that deals with emails, and the
thing you are trying to accomplish is formatting an email. So your method name
can be <code>format_email</code>.</p>

<p>With this first task solved, knowing the method name, you can already go ahead
and write down the method definition:</p>

<p><code>ruby
def format_email
end
</code></p>

<p>While this is a pretty useless method, since it does nothing at all, it already
<em>is</em> a valid method. So that&#39;s good progress already: you&#39;ve made the first
step.</p>

<p>The next question to ask is: &quot;Does this method need to be given any information
in order to do its thing?&quot; The answer to this question specifies the method&#39;s
arguments list.</p>

<p>In our example, the answer probably is that, in order to format an email, it
needs the email.</p>

<p>So you can now add the argument list to the method:</p>

<p><code>ruby
def format_email(email)
end
</code></p>

<p>With these two things solved you can now start thinking about implementing
the method body. How can you transform the email into some formatted text?</p>

<p>You&#39;d add a new line between <code>def</code> and <code>end</code>, and make sure it&#39;s indented by
two spaces (hit <code>tab</code>, unless your editor does it for you), and start focussing
on the code that makes up the method body:</p>

<p><code>ruby
def format_email(email)
  ...
end
</code></p>

<p>You see how we&#39;ve split up the task of writing a new method into three smaller
tasks, and worked on each one of them after another.</p>

<p>Even though this might seem trivial at first, we recommend you get into this
habit, too.</p>

<p>Btw, good editors help you format things. For example, when you are on a
line that starts with <code>def something</code>, and at the end of the line hit return,
Sublime will already indent the next line for you by 2 spaces. If you now type
<code>end</code>, then Sublime will notice that you are closing the method, and outdent
it again, so <code>def</code> and <code>end</code> sit on the same level. Smart, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;ll notice that when you type an opening parenthesis <code>(</code>, then Sublime
will add a closing one <code>)</code> too, but keep your cursor placed between them, so
you can type the argument list where it belongs.</p>

<p>Exercises: Now would be a good time to do some of the <a href="/exercises/methods_1.html">exercises on
methods</a>.</p>
