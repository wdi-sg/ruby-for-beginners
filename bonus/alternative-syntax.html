        <h1>Alternative Syntax</h1>

<p>You have, so far, learned that Strings are defined using single or double
quotes, like so:</p>

<p><code>ruby
&quot;A String&quot;
&#39;Another String&#39;
</code></p>

<p>And Arrays are defined using square brackes, with a comma separated list of
objects, like so:</p>

<p><code>ruby
[&quot;One&quot;, &quot;Two&quot;, &quot;Three&quot;]
</code></p>

<p>We&#39;d like to quickly mention two alternative syntaxes for defining the same
objects, even though they&#39;re not used very often. However, you may sometimes
find them in other people&#39;s code, so it&#39;s useful to know they exist.</p>

<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>First, Ruby has an alternative syntax for defining strings that goes like so:</p>

<p><code>%[any-character]The actual string[the same character]</code></p>

<p>Meaning, that when there&#39;s a percentage character <code>%</code> followed by any other
character, which also closes the whole thing, then this defines a string, too.</p>

<p>For examples these definitions all mean exactly the same:</p>

<p><code>ruby
&quot;A String&quot;
&#39;A String&#39;
%(A String)
%{A String}
%|A String|
</code></p>

<p>Which character is used to open and close the string is a matter of style, and
preference. The author of this text prefers round paratheses for readability,
but others prefer curly braces or pipes. There&#39;s no very clear convention in
the Ruby community.</p>

<p>When would you use this alternative syntax?</p>

<p>Sometimes you need to define a string that itself contains (or may contain, in
future versions) the same quote character that you&#39;ve used to define the string.
For example, if you have a string that contains the string <code>&quot;Name&quot;</code>, including
the quotes, but in the same string you&#39;d also like to use
<a href="/bonus/string_interpolation.html">String interpolation</a>, so you&#39;d normally
use double quotes to define the string. In that case you&#39;d need to escape the
double quotes that are contained in your string.</p>

<p>It probably helps to look at an example. Imagine you&#39;re working on an
application that asks the user for an email address, validates the format of
the given address, and then displays an error message if the format looks
invalid:</p>

<p><code>
The given email address &quot;ruby@monstas&quot; does not look like a valid email address.
</code></p>

<p>Using double quotes your code might look like this:</p>

<p><code>ruby
address = &quot;ruby@monstas&quot;
message = &quot;The given email address \&quot;#{address}\&quot; does not look like a valid email address.&quot;
puts message
</code></p>

<p>Try running this code, and then also try removing the backslashes, and running
it again. You&#39;ll get a syntax error message because Ruby thinks the second
double quote (after <code>address</code>) closes the first one, so it would look at
<code>#{...}</code> outside of a string, which is not valid Ruby.</p>

<p>While the above code, including the backslash characters, is valid Ruby code,
it looks a little ugly. Typing this stuff is kinda cumbersome, and programmers
usually hate it.</p>

<p>So Ruby gives us another, nicer way to express the same:</p>

<p><code>ruby
message = %(The given email address &quot;#{address}&quot; does not look like a valid email address.)
</code></p>

<p>Also, this allows us to freely change the message later, without having to
change the quotes. For example, if our original message would have looked like
so:</p>

<p><code>ruby
message = %(The given email address does not look like a valid email address.)
</code></p>

<p>We could now change it to say the following without changing the quotes:</p>

<p><code>ruby
message = %(The given email address doesn&#39;t look like a valid email address.)
</code></p>

<h2>Arrays</h2>

<p>Imagine you are running a programming study group, and you want to quickly
write a piece of code that runs a little raffle to assign people to pairs
randomly.</p>

<p><code>ruby
people = [
  &quot;Anne&quot;,
  &quot;Elizabeth&quot;,
  &quot;Erica&quot;,
  &quot;Iryna&quot;,
  &quot;Johanna&quot;,
  &quot;Juliane&quot;,
  &quot;Katja&quot;,
  &quot;Katrin&quot;,
  &quot;Maria&quot;,
  &quot;Renate&quot;,
  &quot;Sureka&quot;,
  &quot;Miriam&quot;,
  &quot;Zazie&quot;,
  &quot;Anja&quot;
]
people.shuffle.each_slice(2) do |pair|
  puts pair.join(&#39;, &#39;)
end
</code></p>

<p>Well, this code works. But wouldn&#39;t it be cool to be able to define the array
without having to write out all those quotes and commas? They&#39;re quite
cumbersome to type, aren&#39;t they? Also, if we could omit them then we could just
copy and paste that list of names from some where else, without modifying it
further.</p>

<p>Luckily, Ruby provides us with a piece of syntax that does exactly this:</p>

<p><code>ruby
people = %w(
  Anne
  Elizabeth
  Erica
  Iryna
  Johanna
  Juliane
  Katja
  Katrin
  Maria
  Renate
  Sureka
  Miriam
  Zazie
  Anja
)
people.shuffle.each_slice(2) do |pair|
  puts pair.join(&#39;, &#39;)
end
</code></p>

<p>The <code>w</code> in <code>%w(...)</code> stands for &quot;words&quot;, which means an array defined like this
will always only contain strings. So, <code>%w(1 2 3 4)</code> would result in the same
array as <code>[&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;]</code>.</p>
