        <h1>Top-level object</h1>

<p>So, we&#39;ve learned that objects come with lots of methods attached to them.  And
we&#39;ve seen how we can use them to do interesting things with the object, by the
way of calling these methods.</p>

<p>Now, if you pop into <code>irb</code>, or if you write the following code into an otherwise
empty Ruby file, this works:</p>

<p>```ruby
$ irb</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is<em>a?(Object)
true
methods
[:to</em>s, :inspect, ... ]
```</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, as you can see we can use some methods in Ruby without even defining an
object at all: They&#39;re already there. And the method <code>is_a?</code> tells us that this
already is an object ... whatever &quot;this&quot; is.</p>

<p>What&#39;s up with that?</p>

<p>This is something that pretty much blows some people&#39;s minds, confuses the heck
out of others, while yet others don&#39;t even notice or think about it at all. It
is also something, that, when you ask around on your local Ruby meetup, very
few people can explain in a satisfying, and clear way. And neither do we, yet.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s still try.</p>

<p>Whenever you open IRB and it presents that prompt to you, or when you create a
new, empty Ruby file ... Ruby will not only execute your code: Before she does
she first creates an empty, anonymous Object, and kind of places you inside of
it.</p>

<p>This empty Object kind of seems invisible, and it seems that those methods
that we can define in this scope (space) were somehow &quot;standing alone&quot;. In fact
they aren&#39;t. They&#39;re defined on this empty, anonymous Object that we usually
don&#39;t see.</p>

<p>This Object often is referred to as the <em>top-level scope</em> in Ruby.</p>

<p class="hint">
The top-level scope is an empty, anonymous object. All Ruby code starts in here.
</p>

<p>Confusing? Yeah. Don&#39;t worry. This is something many Ruby programmers do and
use everyday without ever asking the question why it works, exactly.</p>

<p>Hopefully some of this will become more clear once you&#39;ve written your
own methods and classes.</p>
