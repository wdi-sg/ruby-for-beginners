        <h1>Inversion of control</h1>

<p>In Ruby there are a lot more methods that accept blocks, and they do very
different things. However, they have one thing in common:</p>

<p>By accepting a block, from you as a programmer, the method can pass control to
you.</p>

<p>This design is an example for the principle of <em>inversion of control</em>, and
it&#39;s the real reason why Rubyists love blocks so much.</p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>In short it means that Matz, the creator of Ruby, put a tool in place that can
be used to allow methods to pass control to its users (i.e. you as a
programmer).</p>

<p>&quot;Control&quot; in this context refers to the question who gets to decide how things
work.</p>

<p>In older languages, where there was no such tool, people either had to
implement lots of very specific methods, and <em>guess</em> what users might need in
the future. Or they&#39;d decide to just not implement any of these methods at all.</p>

<p>For example, in Ruby, we don&#39;t have to define lots of methods like <code>select_odd</code>,
<code>select_even</code>, <code>select_lesser_than</code>, <code>select_greater_than</code> and so on, ... where
each of these methods would be useful for one very specific usecase.</p>

<p>Instead, the class <code>Array</code> only has to implement one single, very generic
method for arrays: <code>select</code>. Since Ruby has blocks, the method can allow you
(as a programmer) to specify the criterion yourself: by passing a piece of
code, in the form of block to the method.</p>

<p>That way Ruby lets you, as a programmer, take over control, and specify what is
used as a criterion to select elements.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we mention this is because we think this is a nice example
of a pretty abstract principle applied to software design. There are lots of
other principles like these, and they&#39;ll make more and more sense to you over
time. Programming languages and code, from this perspective, is a subject of
design, and thus art, as well as social and cultural questions ... much rather
than strictly logical or technical ones.</p>
